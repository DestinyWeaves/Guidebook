# Introduction to Destiny Weaves

This is the guidebook for Destiny Weaves, a semi-literate play-by-post text roleplay game set in the Pern universe and operated through JCINK and Discord.

If you don't know about the amazing world that Anne McCaffery created, we'd be more than happy to fill you in -- though we would suggest reading the books too, we promise they're entertaining!

As wonderful as Anne's world was, there are glaring issues that just show the mindset of the time in which they were written. So Destiny Weaves was created to not only fix those issues but to add more depth to Anne's already colourful world.

So you'd like the option of a warmongering Lord Holder hell bent on causing chaos and bloodshed? Come join us! We're more than happy to let our players influence the plot. All we've done is give you a starting point to jump into. Where it goes, is up to you and destiny. How about creating a candidate to FINALLY get the gold? More than welcome here, but there are a number of changes you should be aware of. 

Want to create a mildly senile Councilmember with an addiction to bubbly pie? You're certainly welcome to... we'd even create an event for those delicious bubbly pies in game. Don't be afraid to get wild with it. The only think we ask is that you pretty please remember to read up on the history so your information falls in line with the rest of the site. We're pretty much willing to allow almost everything into play but you must provide a detailed explanation.

We look forward to writing with you!
