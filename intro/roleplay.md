This is a server for a semi-literate play-by-post roleplaying game. That is to say, a semi-improvisatory collaborative group storytelling activity, conducted principally through short story segments writers submit as part of a larger running story, in which participants have defined storytelling responsibilities centered around the perspectives and actions of specific characters.

When you participate on this site, you are a writer first and foremost. This page exists to attempt to describe the a set of norms and social expectations that writers should adhere to when they participate, but it is not the final authority on what those norms or expectations are.

## Characters

As a writer, you are responsible for telling parts of a single shared story with the other writers, and will do so by narrating short individual posts within specific scenes within that larger shared story. Stories are about characters who make choices to overcome conflict and change as a result of those choices; therefore, as a writer you will design specific fictional ‘main characters’ that you will use as a primary tool for storytelling. From time to time, you may also write ‘incidental characters’ who are not main characters, often referred to as Non-Player Character, commonly abbreviated as NPC.

### Staying In-Scope

**Many possible characters you could design are not in scope for our story.** Our story is not about characters who have no meaningful way to impact or be impacted by other existing elements, nor is it about characters whose scenes would be needlessly tedious or unpleasant for other writers to collaborate on. Writers are asked to submit character designs for staff approval, but this approval does not guarantee a character will remain in scope forever. Characters can and do change in ways that put them out-of-scope, and **whether or not an out-of-scope character “exists”, the result is the same: Our story is not *about* them.**

### *With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility*

As a writer, you have almost absolute autonomy over the actions and dialogue for your main characters but in turn you carry final responsibility for exercising that autonomy wisely to ensure that the way you write them remains in-scope.

At times, you may need to write other ‘incidental’ characters as part of a scene; NPCs, mooks, extras; there are many terms for this. For most purposes a writer has the same autonomy and responsibilities for an incidental character they’ve taken on, but this can be handed off to other players, and ends when the character goes out of scope (such as by having them exit the scene).

### Character Self-Interest

Characters have self-interested goals and take actions to further those goals. While your goals as a writer are intrinsically at odds with those goals, it is important to write your characters as making choices that are consistent with their self-interest and goals. It’s especially important to write incidental characters in a way that is consistent with *their own* goals, rather than with the goals of a main character they are interacting with.

### Autonomy Does Not Mean Sovereignty

It is not appropriate for a writer to write specific non-obvious character actions or dialogue for other writers’ main characters. It can, though, be appropriate to assume that another writer’s character performs some inconsequential automatic reaction — such as reciprocating to a high-five or handshake. (But even so, a skilled writer avoids explicitly stating those reactions and prefers to only imply them.)

### Stories are about Failure

It bears repeating: your goals as a writer are *intrinsically* at odds with the goals of the characters under your control. Your goal **must not** be for a character to succeed in their goals, but rather to explore the way their attempts to succeed unfold and the way the character responds and changes in the process. As a writer, it’s essential for you to intentionally seek out and engineer opportunities for your character to fail to achieve their goals, and to ensure that any eventual success you engineer is justified by the way the character has developed in the process of reaching it.

## Improvised Roleplay

Roleplay is an intrinsically improvisatory activity. While the rules used for live improv theater are not quite the same or quite so absolute when applied to play-by-post, all the same principles apply.  
Ours is a *semi*\-improvisatory format, and to the extent that things can be discussed out-of-character and different plans made these rules are even less absolute than normal.

But in general, when you write:

### Make Choices

Make meaningful choices, and describe those choices with a level of detail that allows other writers to understand them. Other writers rely on information they receive from you to play their own part. Your posts should answer the implicit questions posed by their previous posts, and pose implicit questions for them to answer.

Other writers are not entitled to make meaningful choices about the actions your characters take, therefore often those implicit questions will be specifically about your character — such as waiting for them to speak. Be wary about this, though: you still have the responsibility to make choices about other elements of the scene. Writing a character to take the obvious action or make the obvious comment does not usually amount to a meaningful choice, especially not when another writer has already implied that reaction.

### Say “Yes, and…”

Participate in the conflicts and themes that other players have already established, and incorporate choices other writers have made into your writing.  
If another writer has described a doorway, write your character to enter the scene via that doorway. If another writer has described the occasion, write them to be dressed for that occasion. If there is an ongoing conflict, select a character to write who can participate in that conflict. And if another writer’s character sets out a trap or intends to deceive yours, you should almost always write your character to fall for it.

### No Negation

Accept what other writers post as canonical fact for a scene — details posted within a scene overrides any more general source of ‘canon’ for that scene, including this guidebook. Telling stories often requires bending the truth, and “don’t let the truth get in the way of a good story” applies double when that “truth” is itself a work of fiction.  
Writers are expected to roll with deviations as best they are able. If it’s really a problem, bring it up out-of-character, or choose to participate in a scene you do understand. It’s *never* appropriate to make a direct contradiction in-character, even as or against something written as character dialogue, unless it’s discussed out-of-character first.

### Everything Affects You

Ensure your character remains in a position to be affected by choices that other writers make, and leave most elements you make choices about open to modification or addition by other writers.  
A set of chairs you describe should allow another writer to add their character sitting in one. A list of cult members shouldn’t definitively exclude other characters not on it from having also been a member all along. A family tree should be an invitation to build new long-lost cousins. And a character’s backstory should include more than enough skeleton-closets to allow for whatever newly-discovered skeletons a plot might need.

### Physicalize

Show, don’t tell\! Provide sensory details about a character’s experience, and articulate the mental states and reasoning that justifies a character’s actions. 

## Plotting and Scheming

While the ‘main’ activity of roleplay is writing roleplay posts, out-of-character discussion is an essential part of forming more cohesive stories and character arcs.

### Architects and Explorers

Different people have different preferences for how much they will pre-plan about what they write. Some writers choose to develop detailed character arcs with elaborately engineered schemes for challenging their characters to develop in certain ways; others choose to follow the flow and their sense for what a character is and how they think, and find the story they are writing along the way.  
Both approaches are valuable and necessary for a healthy roleplay community, and a skilled writer will engage with both types of writing to some degree, instead of doing exclusively one or the other.

### Your Character Is An Idiot

As one of the most basic ways of collaborating beyond pure exploration, writers will often include extra details in their posts that are not known to the characters of a scene. (Writers are in fact rarely excused from the expectation that they do so). Sometimes, though, that’s not enough, and a writer needs to communicate things out-of-charater, especially when there is a lot of extra information or there are specific things that would be cumbersome to integrate into their post.  
   
Your characters do not know everything that you as a writer know. Our goal as writers is to engineer failure more than success, and while it’s not always wrong to have a character infer or intuit things, out-of-character information should be used to make characters *wrong* about things perhaps even more often than it should be used to make them right.

### Your Character Is An Asshole

Characters are not perfect, and characters who are even *close* are usually out of scope.  
Your characters need to grow and develop: that can mean having them become less *or* more flawed, and many of the obstacles that lead them to develop will be their own mistakes, missteps, and sins.  
Characters who behave in antisocial ways often make for good stories, but it’s especially important to communicate when you write one, because a scene needs to be enjoyed by all of the writers collaborating on it.  
Avoid rationalizing character actions. Be frank about your characters unflattering motives. Avoid using euphemisms for things your character does, says, or thinks. Rationalizing and using euphemisms are something for your *character* to do, not for you as a writer to do when discussing them with other writers out-of-character. The more you embrace the degree to which your character *is* factually an asshole, the easier it is to make them an *interesting* asshole.

### Engineer Situations For More Than Just You

Like you, other writers have their own goals for how their characters should develop. While you too can develop plans all on your own, the best plans are the ones that require collaboration from multiple other writers. Likewise, other writers may have ideas that are useful to you; even scenes that don’t seem to help your character goals can usually be made to with a bit of discussion.

A plan that involves a specific character needs to be planned in collaboration with that character’s writer; plans involving a character made without their writer are not always violations of autonomy per-se (you’re allowed to dream), but putting them into practice to railroad a character *is* a violation even if those involved manage to avoid posting specific character actions and dialogue.

### Always Stick to the Plan

Writers may have carefully-orchestrated plans for their characters, and need other writers in a scene they are writing to help them execute those plans. Your characters or writing style may not always be a perfect fit for these plans, and it’s often necessary to discuss in advance how the other writer’s plans can be made to work with what you want to write. You may have alternative ideas that you think would serve the other writer’s goals, so discuss them and see if they can agree — but don’t just decide that on your own; they may have other considerations you haven’t the least idea about. Even when things go off the rails, try to write in a way that still helps them satisfy their same goals.

### Never Stick to the Plan

Sun tzu once wrote that no plan survives contact with other writers, or something like that. When you set up excessively elaborate plans that require specific sequences of events, you set yourself up for failure. Life is unpredictable, so are other people, and characters are not going to do or say exactly the things that you expect them to. While you might be able to get one specific boat to move the way you want, there’s no use trying to command the tide.

Plan for overarching themes and outcomes more than for specific moments. Don’t tell other writers what their characters should do, tell them what you are trying to accomplish in the scene and let them supply how their characters can make that happen — other writers hate being told what to do, but they love being brought in and made part of the process.

Sometimes, a plan you’ve made will become so far derailed that its original goal will seem or perhaps even be impossible. As a writer you should embrace this, because embedded in this is always an opportunity to write something you might never have managed on your own: now you get to write a doomed hero to a cathartic death barely short of sainthood, use their ignominy to comment on the injustice inherent in systems of power, or perhaps even invent some new *villainous* end.
