# Join the DestinyWeaves Community

## Discord Server

Join [the Destiny Weaves discord server](https://discord.gg/4SgEpuzqYR) by following the link, or clicking on the Discord icon in the top bar.

Accept the community rules, and make sure to change your discord nickname if needed -- your nickname needs to contain only latin characters, both so you can be easily @-mentioned and so you can create a JCINK accout with the same name.

## JCINK Site

In order to participate in Destiny Weaves, you will need to register for an account. This will be your main account, used for interacting writer-to-writer and keeping track of the full set of characters that belong to you.

Visit the [Account Registration Page](https://destinyweaves.jcink.net/index.php?act=Reg&CODE=00) by clicking on the link, or navigating to https://destinyweaves.jcink.net/ and clicking "register" in the top bar.

If you agree to the rules, check the box and press "the "register" button. Fill out the form on the following page, including a username that matches your discord username (i.e. without the @ prefix), and press submit. Follow the promps to complete the email validation by clicking on the link sent to your email.

# Create a Character

## Character Concepts

Before you begin writing up a character to submit them, it's STRONGLY encouraged to join the #characterbuilding channel, to brainstorm character concepts, refine your ideas, and discuss opportunities for incorporating details into your character's backstory that can tie them into the setting and plot.

We want full three-dimensional characters, with hopes, dreams, flaws, and potential for growth; and who can integrate with ongoing storylines and more generally with the established canon of Destiny Weaves.

We don't expect you to manifest such a character as a fully-formed immaculate virgin birth directly from your forehead. We also don't expect you to know every single detail about Destiny Weaves or Pern in order to ensure your character's personal timeline matches up with our canon.
What we expect is that you'll be willing to discuss your goals and vision for your character, and to reshape the character concept into a version that suits this community's collaborative story.

## Forum Sub-Account

Each main character you write will be written using a separate sub-account per character, to more easily keep track of which characters are in each scene.

To create a new sub-account, visit he [Sub-Accounts Maangement Page](https://destinyweaves.jcink.net/index.php?act=UserCP&CODE=54) using the link, or by navigating to your user settings, and selecting the section labeled "edit sub-accounts".

Press the "Register a New Account" button on this page, fill out the form, and submit it. The username should be the name of the character you are creating. Submit the form to reach the new-account welcome page (which should state "The administrator wishes to preview all new registered accounts MANUALLY".)

Navigate to the new account's [Profile Information Page](https://destinyweaves.jcink.net/index.php?act=UserCP&CODE=01). Fill out the provided form fields with information for the character, and hit "Amend my profile" to save it.

Navigate to the new account's [Avatar Settings Page](https://destinyweaves.jcink.net/index.php?act=UserCP&CODE=24). Upload or paste a link to an avatar image for your new character, and hit "Update Avatar" to save it.

Navigate to the new account's **public** profile page, and verify that the contents of the profile are what you expected.

Copy the URL of this page (which should be of the form <code>https://destinyweaves.jcink.net/?showuser=<i>number</i></code>), and navigate to the [#app-reviews](https://discord.com/channels/1050092859317035038/1050634202619580447) channel on the Destiny Weaves discord server. Post, in a single message, your chracter's name, a one-sentence summary of the character, and the link to the profile page.

## Character Review

{: note }
> This is not simply an accept/reject process! Do not submit a character who is so precious you could never bear to change them!

Once a moderator or another senior community member is available, they will look over the character you submitted in [#app-reviews](https://discord.com/channels/1050092859317035038/1050634202619580447).
Once ready, the reviewer will ping you in #characterbuilding, to discuss the character with you.
We want to make sure we're able to create opportunities for your character to take on a meanful role; and it's imperative that we make sure you understand your role in driving your character to change over the course of play.

Usually, a reviewer will identify one or more issues with the character that need to be resolved before they can be played. Very minor issues (e.g. spelling mistakes) may be small enough for a reviewer to still approve the character with a stipulation that the issues be fixed before you start posting with them. Otherwise, you will be expected to resolve those issues first.

Your reviewer will try to make it clear as early as possible, what the blocking issues are that prevent their approval. You are welcome to ask for further information and advice on how to resolve these issues, and to discuss and post edited versions in discord to get further feedback. Once a reviewer is satisfied with your edits, they'll approve the character and move them into play -- or, if the edits take a while, you're welcome to resubmit the character later. 


{: warning-title }
> A word of warning to reviewers
>
> As writers, there is always the urge to offer up your own ideas as solutions to problems you've identified, especially when reviewing someone else's work.
> Those comments can _sometimes_ be helpful -- but keep a _very_ tight rein on your ego when you try to help in this way.
> You **MUST NOT** allow yourself to judge a player's writing negatively when they fix issues in ways you do not expect.
> Players are _never_ obligated to incorporate your ideas, regardless of how well you think they would suit the goals you think their writing ought to have.


# How to create your first character

So unlike other sites, we have a sub-account system for characters. All characters are to be linked directly to a player account so it makes easier for you to switch between characters depending on what you are doing. You ‘ll find a lot of players will sit in their player account and only switch over when they know they have replies to do for a certain character. 

On the top bar, the same as where you saw the register and login buttons. You’ll see a toothed gear icon. Click on that and scroll down until you see an ‘EDIT SUB-ACCOUNT’ link. Click on that link. 

There you’ll see a table where ‘username’ and registered’ information will be kept, and just below that are ‘Delink account’ and ‘Register a new account’ buttons. Click the Register new account button. 

Once you’ve done this, you’ll be greeted with a ‘Terms and Conditions’ page, in order to continue please read and click the checkbox to accept to get on the next step. A page will load up that looks exactly like the page when you first registered to the site. Please fill out the relevant information for your character then click

# Custom Dragonspeech Codes

Users who wish to have a custom dragonspeech format may request it. This can include a gradient background or other similar features. Users are specifically encouraged to request a format code instead of hardcoding a format by other means.

To Request this, please either post in the discord channel `#attn-staff`, or you can go to [Here](linkhere) and use the provided form in that post to send in your request.

In order to ensure that your dragonspeech code works with the accessibility-mode toggle enabled, also include accessibility-mode colors in your request — that is, a foreground and background color for each of light and dark mode.  
Accessibility mode is specifically designed to ensure that posts are readable to *all*, even those with nonstandard vision, dyslexia, or other impairments. Note though, **accessibility is usability**: a significant fraction of this site uses this mode simply to avoid eye strain or visual discomfort.  

In order to accomplish this, there are defined rules about what color combinations can be accepted. A technical definition is given below, but in practice that definition boils down to “dark text on a pastel background” in light-mode and “light text on a dark tinted background” in dark mode.  
The accessibility-mode colors selected MUST confirm to the WebAIM WCAG color contrast guidelines, with a minimum 7:1 contrast ratio between foreground and background and a maximum of 2:1 contrast ratio between the text background and site background. (Ideally, select colors that give around 8:1 and 1.5:1 respectively, and use fully desaturated grays for foreground.) You can verify a particular color choice meets accessibility guidelines with [this tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). Staff reserves the right to edit accessibility-mode colors to bring them in line with these accessibility-mode requirements.
