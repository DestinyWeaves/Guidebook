# Character Creation Guidelines

In Destiny Weaves, the idea is that your character is more than their bond.

They are a person and the need to present them as such is paramount.

They should have flaws, they should have problems, and they should be *human. They should be realistically human-* a character who has had traumatic experiences in their lives isn’t going to skip around loving the world. You should expect your character to change and grow over time.

# General Guidelines

* Any character may have 2 firelizards to start with : Bronze, Quartz(Light), Aster, Brown, Blue, Ixia, Green\], tokens for a higher ranking firelizards are sent out when you join so you would be get to 1 firelizard ranging from gold, ruby or dark quartz.  
* Tokens for extra firelizards\[More than a Faire\]  are available in the store, but if you wish your character to impress to a dragon or wher, they can not have more than 4 as your head would become too full for them to find space.   
* Please DO have a character arc ready. We love to see your characters grow, change and adapt to their surroundings. If you have a little sub plot for your character, feel free to message staff about it and we’ll see what we can do to give it some… ‘lighting’ to aid in the development.   
* Creating for other players. We do welcome this, but you should know that if you create a sibling for one person’s character, no one else is going to take that spot so that character may be stuck if you leave. *This isn’t a ‘don’t do it’ but more ‘be prepared to be in it for the long haul’ warning.*   
* Romantic subplots. We do love a good bit of romantic plotting, but also be aware if you create this character and they don’t gel, don’t be disappointed. Sometimes things don’t work out how we plan, but they might find their partner in someone who wasn’t expecting it\! \[you’d be surprised how often characters that end up together were never envisioned as becoming partners\].

## Dragons

* Any color is freely available to create except gold, rubies and dark quartz. \[if you wish to make one of these, please refer to the hatching records/npc records, you may find one available for creation\]  
  * Female rubies are currently limited to 1 per player \[this may change in the future\]  
*  60% is the “Base” color, 40% can be any other color, including accents.  
* Dragon rebonding: dragon babies rebonding does happen  but it is **exceptionally rare.**  
* 	If a player leaves the site after adopting an NPC Adoptable dragon/wher without posting a leave of absence AND before the dragonkin is 6 months old, the weyrling/wherling can undergo Re-Impression. A character can see if the dragon/wher will choose them as a re-bond. This will only ever happen ONCE for a baby dragon, as bonding breaking and impression takes a lot of mental willpower and strength. So if the new bond leaves the site, the dragon will between.


* Impression or reimpression of adult firelizards isn't allowed. Impression happens at hatching. However in rare cases it is possible to get on friendly terms with wild firelizards but they will never impress. If a wher never bonds to a person, they will never be able to make a bond. But it has been known for whers to break their bond and then rebond to another. Firelizards will never re-bond to a human and will instead either go between or go wild. This does not mean that the firelizard can’t even get on friendly terms with other players and you may be lucky enough to find a clutch from the firelizard on your bed\!

*   Impression of dragons outside of on-screen hatchings are allowed but you should refer to the hatching records to get the timelines right. Fort especially keeps very meticulous records. 

## Wher

* Any color is freely available to create except gold, rubies and dark quartz. \[if you wish to make one of these, please refer to the hatching records/npc records, you may find one available for creation\]  
  * Female rubies are currently limited to 1 per player \[this may change in the future\]  
* 60% is the ‘base’ color, 40% can be any other color, including accents  
* Wher rebonding does happen although **it is very rare.**   
* OOC: In rare cases, if a player leaves the site, for an extended period of time without posting a leave of absence, the wher can then choose to break its bond and go up for re-bonding. Again, this only ever happens once for a wher, as the strain of bond breaking and re-bonding is mentally taxing for the wher. 

# **Age Guidelines**

*  Dragon Candidate Age Range: 18+ 

\[aged out people very VERY rarely impress and are always non-wingriders\[threadfall fighting\] riders, this can be brought as a token. 

*     Wher Candidate Age Range: 18+

    \*Certain crafts have stricter age restrictions and will be called out below.

*     Apprentice Age: 12+   
*     Journeyman Age: 20+   
*     Mastercrafter Age: 35+   
*     Craftmaster Age: 40+   
*     Healers and Vinters 20+ for Journeymen, 35+ for Mastercrafter, 40+ for Craftmaster   
*     Guards Trainees 16+, Guardsmen/women after two turns of training (Senior Guards have been guards for over 7 turns)  
*     Runners 14+ 

    Characters under the age of 18 will not have their dragon or wher rising, chasing, or running for mating flights and runs, as they will not engage these behaviors until their bonded is 18+, its also known that many will chose not to rise or run until their bonded is READY. 

## Names

Pernese Colonists lost the use of surnames by the middle of the First Pass, as  the harkened back to a time on Earth’s ‘Black Death’- where you needed to distinguish between John the Blacksmith, and John the Baker-\> John Smith and John Baker.

**Ruthia** and **Xanthos** went on to have a son, **Rutos**, and a daughter, **Xanthia**, who became **X’ia** when impressed.   
Most characters' names work like this, siblings tend to have somewhat vastly different names. Both men and women can have their names elided.   
	

* Human names never end in ‘-th’ or ‘-sk’ those are reserved for dragons and whers. 

Ex : Dragon know their names at hatching, Whers will add their bonded’s name to their own. EG: Sarin bonded to a wher who became Quartz Sarisk.\[Although quartz are only called quartz, there is a notable distinction in both size and clutch amount in those hues. For the sake of staff, we separate them into two categories, dark quartz and light quartz\]. 

### Divergence from Book Canon

*  There are more Colors: Gold(Female), Ruby(Female/Male),Bronze(Male), Quartz(Female/Male), Brown(Male), Blue(Male), Teal(Female/Male), Green(Female).  
  * Firelizards & Whers come in the same flavors.  
  * Female/Male- indicates that the dragonkin comes as either. So you could have a Male Quartz or female quartz.  
      
* **HADs (Hears All Dragons) and similar abilities are not a part of our canon.** Dragons and whers may direct speech to whomever they wish, but there will be no 'innate ability' for characters to hear mindspeak not directed at them.  
    
* References or knowledge of 'timing it' (traveling between through time) are not allowed. Destiny Weaves is set at the beginning of the 8th Pass, and Lessa(& all Canon characters have never existed though similar events did take place in broad strokes.  
* All of the Weyrs and some of the larger and more established Major Holds have proper flushing toilets with piping. Weyr Kitchens have running water.

## Histories

Character histories are designed to tell people about the characters' lives before arriving to their current situation.

Histories should mention: Family (parents and siblings, or people who might be considered family if their biological family isn’t in the picture.

Histories should contain-

* Major defining events, if you want to bullet point them, or write a paragraph or two detailing what happened that’s acceptable.  
* Histories should not contain personality traits but the history and a character's personality should make sense together.

## Appearances

* Skin color runs the gamut of normal human skin tones.  
* Hair and eye color are relatively normal human range.

## Transferring to Another Game

If someone decides to leave the game. They’re welcome to take their dragon with them, but Destiny Weaves should be credited with the creation of the dragon.
