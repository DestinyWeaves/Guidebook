# The Rules

Destiny Weaves is an **18+ Mature**, [3-3-3 Rating](https://rpgrating.com) site.

## ISLE Version of Rules

Please note that these rules  were written for [Dragonfire Isles]((https://dragonfireisles.jcink.net/), with some slight modifications, we have used them with the site’s permission.

 Rule 8 is purely  content created by Destiny Weaves staff.

### Behavior & Conduct

1. Staff reserves the right to remove people from the site. Staff reserves the right to remove any individual from the community; even if a rule was not explicitly broken, we can and will ask you to leave our site if we believe it is for the benefit of all parties involved.
2. Meta-gaming and powerplay is unacceptable in any form. Unless previously discussed and agreed to between players, you should never attempt to control or overpower a character that is not yours. Please try to act within the general bounds of roleplay etiquette, and do not assume that your actions over another character are fair game without the player’s approval.
3. We're all adults here, and we expect you to behave as such. You don't have to agree with everyone, but you are expected to be cordial. This includes any form of bigotry, harassment, racism, sexism, prejudice, or other types of disrespect.
   * Members are encouraged to contact Staff if they're having difficulties with someone or they feel that personal conflict with another person is interfering with their ability to enjoy writing here.
4. Respect the Staff and the site. We're not saying that you have to defer absolute authority to us, or treat us as some omnipotent power; however, we do ask that you show some respect for the time and energy we put into the site. Staffing is not a job or a paid position, and anyone who is a Staff member here does so on a volunteer basis, and is willingly dedicating their free time to creating a safe environment.
5. Communication is required. Communication is a cornerstone of healthy roleplay etiquette, in our opinions. Especially on a site where we may deal with darker themes or allow harsher stories that others may find difficult, there is absolutely no excuse not to be in communication with your writing partners. “Ghosting” is not an acceptable form of etiquette here; messages should be sent out to the appropriate and relevant parties to notify them of your intentions. Ghosting us, the site, or your writing partners with no notice may result in denying or pending further apps, archiving the ones you do have, or refusal to allow you to rejoin the site.
6. All triggering or sensitive content is required to be tagged accordingly. Our site routinely deals in darker themes and offers avenues to write more difficult or sensitive topics that can be, or more than likely are, triggering in nature. We have a variety of tags and codes on the site to make this easy; should you opt to not use these codes, any warnings should be made in a bolded or emphasized fashion, with a complete list of all triggers/content by topic and name, at the start of the post or application.

### Registration & Accounts

1. All members must be 18+ to join our site. We have a premium subscription, which allows users to plot and write sensitive or mature topics; minors aged 17 and younger are not permitted to register an account on our site. If we have reason to believe you've lied about your age, you will be banned.  
2. We are an Account-Per-Character site. We utilize Jcink's sub-account tool to allow for parent/child accounts; all players should have a main "out of character" (OOC) account to serve as their parent account, using the alias they wish to write under on our site. All subsequent character accounts may be attached to the parent account through the Control Panel. If you are having difficulty registering a sub-account, reach out to a Staff member.  
3. Register your accounts in Proper Case. Just in case you forget, this is enforced by the system at the registration level, so all users should be forced to do this anyways. If you make a mistake while registering, you should be able to change your own username through your Control Panel without admin approval.  
   * Register your names with just the human name \- i.e. "Lessa", not "Lessa & Ramoth" or "Lessa of Gold Ramoth".  
   * We ask for either a "two (2) letter" or "two (2) syllable" difference in account names, just so there's no confusion among players between what account/person/character is being referenced\! This also applies to any "nicknames" for characters, or aliases on the site.  
4. New accounts will need to go through the validation process. By default, all newly registered accounts go into our Validating group and will need to be manually validated by a Staff member. You can have this done by contacting a Staff member in our Discord server to submit an official request. Accounts that are not validated within ninety (90) days will be automatically deleted from the system.  
   * Accounts that are intended to be member accounts should be validated immediately upon request or notification to get you started.  
   * Accounts that are intended to be character accounts will remain in the validation bin until a completed application for them has been accepted by Staff.

### Applications & Profiles
The below section is broken down into three different "sections" \- expectation rules, technical rules, and creation rules. Our **expectation rules** break down our expectations for the body of an application and its content; our **technical rules** detail any technical system rules we have in place that we adhere to, and our **creation rules** detail rules for any character types. Our Expectations

1. We expect the app to be written by you, with no plagiarized content. We expect that any application and character submitted to us was written by yourself, and is not plagiarized or copied from another person. Exceptions can/will be made for any bonded biographies that you have received permission to port between sites, but anything else should be your own work.  
   * We do not accept copy/pastes of events from our Site Timeline.  
   * We do not accept excerpts or rips from other applications on the site.  
2. Should applications be shown to have plagiarized work contained within them, Staff will request that the section be rewritten/redon in your own words within the acceptable parameters for our applications. Unwillingness or inability to make the requested edits may result in a denial of your application or the removal of the account from the site.  
3. We expect the app to provide a logical chronology of their life. Human applications should have a concise chronology of their life provided that provides reasonable explanation for their whereabouts and any decisions they make or beliefs they hold. We want to stress that this doesn't mean their histories need to be lengthy or elaborate, but that any history of theirs should make sense and follow our canon, as well as providing information on the details of their lives. A simple "How they got from Point A (birth) to Point B (present day)" is sufficient.  
4. We expect any major bondables \- dragons, whers, etc. \- to have "descriptive" sections. At a minimum, any "major bondable" creatures attached to character applications \- such as dragons, and whers- must have descriptive sections for their appearance and personality. These descriptive sections do not have to be long or detailed but should encompass the basics of each aspect.

    The reason for this is that short form content \- such as images to show what they look like, or bullet point lists to condense their personality \- is welcome, but does not do a thorough job of displaying unique characteristics or differences between others and themselves:  
   * Images are often "templated" and by nature, do not lend themselves well to displaying anything unique to the creature, such as injuries or mutations, or differences in conformation.  
   * Likewise, the use of bullet point lists is convenient and encouraged, but does not do a good job at describing the nuances of their persona and temperament, or how they interact with others and the world around them.  
5. Additional sections, such as "Mindvoices," "Inspirations" behind the creatures, "Relationships" with others, etc., are optional and not required.  
6. We expect proper attribution for authors and artists. If you didn't create something yourself, proper credits should be given to the author or artist that did it for you. We have accreditation fields available for dragons and whers in our User Control Panel; if you need to provide additional credits, you can also explore options for putting them into the human portion of the application, into your account's signature, or other options.  
7. We expect you to keep the trauma porn to yourself. (Please.) While we allow \- and encourage\! \- our members to write characters with "darker" themes or sensitive topics if that is what they want, there is no need to go into **graphic** or **explicit** detail about whatever traumas your character has encountered.

   (Staff still has to read all of these applications to review them, and even with proper trigger warnings, it can be emotionally exhausting to be subjected to dozens of applications that handle difficult topics in detail. Superficial detail and mentions of them happening are sufficient, but gruesome or gory/graphic details are best left to other mediums such as dev threads and standalone oneshots.)

### Technical Rules

1. We do not employ "slots" or similar quota requirements. We do not limit our members by requirements such as "Must make 200+ posts to have more than six characters" or anything else; so long as you can feasibly keep them all active and continue meeting your activity check requirements, you are allowed to have as many characters at a time as you would like.  
2. You must show proof of activity with previous accounts. While we allow you to create as many characters as you want \- potentially, also as fast as you want \- we do ask that you have a minimum of five (5) IC posts in active threads with your newest character before creating another one. These posts are required to be in a thread with another character/member, and cannot be counted from development threads or tracking threads.  
3. Tokens must be prepared before creation/acceptance. Characters that require tokens \- such as Stands Candidates, Nobles, or Adoptions \- must have the token purchased prior to account creation. We ask that this token is also added to the character account's inventory prior to acceptance for auditing purposes.  
4. There is technically a time-limit for applications. As mentioned previously, all accounts are put in our *Validating* group by default upon being registered with our site. Our validating bin will automatically purge accounts that are older than ninety (90) days old. While we \- the Staff \- personally don't care how long you take to finish an application, the site will remove the account if they are not reviewed, accepted, and validated within that timeframe. Plan accordingly.

### Creation Rules

1. AgesThe following rules regarding ages are in effect:  
   * Official Candidates may not be younger than 18, as per our Candidacy Guide.  
   * We will not Impress characters on-screen that are younger than 17\.  
   * No character may be aged younger than 18\.  
   * Characters you intend to use face claims cannot be below the age of consent.  
2. These rules exist to protect our members, our site, and our characters as well as any potential face claims that may be used, for a variety of legal and/or copyright reasons.  
3. Character Types: We ask that you do NOT create the following characters (as they are  Contest Rewards):  
   * Lords and/or Lady Holders from any Holds.  
   * Past Weyrleaders from any Weyrs.  
   * Craftmasters from any Crafts.  
4. These rules exist because Staff requires having an available pool of NPCs in world leadership to use so that we can influence and change the world state and the politics surrounding each establishment. Members are allowed to create relations to these figures (i.e. A child, sibling, niece/nephew, etc.) provided they are in possession of a Nobility Token.  
5. Weyrlings & Wherlings: Weyrlings are a unique case of character creation, as they are typically "made" when an on-screen Candidate Impresses during a PC hatching to their bondmate. However, if you are wishing to create a bonded rider/handler/diver and play them first as a Weyrling/Wherling after they're accepted, you will likely be required to take one of our NPC slots from one of our previous clutches.  
6. Ranking Positions "Ranking" positions, or positions with a high degree of visibility and responsibility (IC and/or OOC) are defined as any role on our site's \[Avalability\] thread with limited slots. This includes but is not limited to positions such as:  
   * Weyrqueen & Wherqueen, or Junior Queenriders and handlers.  
   * Wingleaders, Wingseconds, and Wingthirds, or equivalent positions.  
   * Candidatemasters, Weyrlingmasters, or their Assistants.  
   * Weyrstaff such as the Headwoman, Steward, Weyrharper and other important positions.  
7. Members are allowed to take any "open" or "available" ranking positions on our site if there is an opening listed in the Availability thread or our Records. Members are limited to a **max allowance of one (1) character** in ranking positions; if one of your WIPs would make you exceed this number, they will not be allowed to hold the position unless someone else on your roster is demoted or steps down. Some positions have "prior experience" requirements you will need to adhere to that will be enforced during any review of their application.

    Ranking characters also have unique posting requirements for their activity on a monthly basis; being unable or unwilling to meet these requirements may result in the position being stripped from your character. If you leave the site or go inactive and fail to meet these requirements as a result, your character will be removed from their position as well. If you return and the position was taken in your absence, the position will not be returned to you.  
8. Retiring a Character \- Characters that are no longer wanted to be played, or lost  your muse?  
   * Ask staff to archive them, In- character they would simply fade into the background and be busy with other things \- “faded out”,  transfer to another Weyr \-“transfered out”, you do have the option to “kill off” a character but they would be unable to return to play.  Transfer and Fade out you have the option to return to them.  
   * If the character has an In-character “Rank”, they may or may not be able to the specific rank. The character cannot ‘rank hop’ trading one rank for another.  
   * Goldriders who are retiring- are a tricky problem.

### Graphics & Coding

1. Images are NOT required. While our profiles and post rows are semi-image heavy at times, you should be able to leave any fields for images blank without it impacting your account, profiles, or posts on the site. They'll just fill in with the default images for the site instead\!  
   * Your Jcink avatar ("Avatar image") may be any size, but no smaller than 100x100.  
   * Your mini profile avatar ("Hover image") must be at least 200x400 in dimension.  
   * Your main profile header ("Header image") must be at least 1040x200 in dimension.  
   * Your accent image ("Post Row Accent image") may be any size, but no smaller than 100x100.  
2. If you do opt to use images on your account, we ask that you are **tasteful in your image choices.** No bikinis, no lingerie, and definitely no exposed chests/breasts, or genitalia. This is out of consideration for members that may browse the site in public; if you wouldn't be comfortable showing it to a coworker, a boss, or a client in a professional setting, don't use it as an image on the site\!  
3. Face claims are encouraged, but NOT mandatory. Face claims are nice, but they are absolutely not a requirement to play here. If you do use a face claim, we ask that they are celebrities well-known to the public, such as famous actors, models or musicians. We do not permit the use of cartoons, anime, or manga as face claims.   
   * At this time, we do not accept faces that are AI generated through sites such as ArtBreeder or DALL-E, or any similar "image breeding" or "text-to-image" generation.  
   * We do allow images with stylized "filters" applied over them to meet stylistic preferences, so long as the image is still identifiable and does not break any other content rules or guidelines on the board.  
4. Coded templates are encouraged, but NOT mandatory. For users that would like to use them, we've provided a selection of templates here on the site. We ask that you do not use any third-party templates from resource sites, as we've had issues with them in the past \- either with them breaking the site or posing issues to legibility, etc. By using only the templates we provide, you are helping us cut down on potential bugs on the skin from broken coding, and aiding users that may have specific needs for templates due to reading or literacy disorders, such as dyslexia.  
   * We do allow you to make your own templates, if you have the ability to. Users that create their own templates are responsible for proofing the coding for accessibility. If your template is difficult to read or break our accessibility standards, we will ask you to adjust or remove it.  
   * Some exceptions to the "no third party codes" rule can be made for quality of life templates, such as auto-trackers for threads. If you're unsure if a template qualifies, please ask.

### Chat Etiquette

1. We have a Discord server, but no public chatbox. The Staff made the elective decision to have a Discord server instead of a cbox; we do not plan to change this. The link to our Discord server is provided in the links at the top of the site; guests are encouraged to join if they're curious about what our community is like.  
2. Please do not privately DM Staff about administrative concerns. In the past, we've run into issues where most or all of us on Staff may be fielding different topics with members in our DMs, which has led to a bumpy road where communication and change are concerned. Additionally, requiring members to DM us for certain concerns has been a breach of boundaries for some members in the past. For the sake of having a clearly defined process of bringing something to Staff's attention while also being mindful of other's boundaries, we ask that all administrative requests are either:  
   * Submitted in a Private Message to th Staff account via an on-site PM.  
   * Submitted in a Private Message to a Staff Member's account via an on-site PM.  
   * Posted publicly in our \#requests/\#faq channels, which is the dedicated channel for fielding administrative requests and questions.  
3. The Discord server is mandatory to join to write with us. Joining the Discord server is a mandatory part of being a member of the site. We understand any hesitation; however, we’ve found this is generally the best medium for exchange of information and chatting. This will likely be the easiest place to get a hold of Staff members if you have questions, as well as where we make any and all announcements pertaining to the site, and will aid in rapid fire plotting with other members.  
   * We know some members prefer a separation of RP time and personal time, and do not wish to be "on" all the time. That's fine\! You can mute the server or disable notifications as needed so that you're only present on the server by your own choice.  
4. Site rules will still apply on the server. Just because we’re technically not “on” the site doesn’t mean all of the above rules go out of the window\! Please act with kindness towards your fellow members, and respect the rules laid out above. The server also has additional rules that are unique to the medium of chatting as opposed to long-form writing on the forum; please make sure you acquaint yourselves with these rules as well:  
   * Be respectful to other members and potential guests while chatting.  
   * Please try to keep things light, and protect your personal information\!  
   * Please keep topics of conversation to their respective channels.  
   * Let staff know if you need a subject change, or de-escalation.  
   * Names on the server have to match names on the site.  
   * Please, don't mini-mod.  
5. These rules are explained further in the \#sever-rules channel of our Discord ser
