# Flora of Pern

This is where you can find all the different plants that grow on Pern divided into two sections, imported and native flora.

Most of the edible plants that are native are edible because the colonists, pre-arrival, had modifications made to their genetics and bodies to aid them in ingesting boron, which is makes up of a great quantity of Pernese organisms. The imported varieties of fruit, herbs, and other plants were cultivated as best as the colonists could and a great many varieties of plants were incorporated into the Pernese ecosystem. In addition, some of the native species of trees, such as Skybroom, offer superior if difficult material for Crafters to work with in building materials.

The links in this section will allow you a deeper look into this flora of Pern and enable you to see what goes where…and <i>why</i>. Medicine? Food? Pollination? We’ve got you covered.
