# Native Flora of Pern
Here's a list of native Pern plant species that can be found all over Pern and a brief outline of their uses.

Oilbrush
: A form of wood that is used for smoking foods as it adds a great taste. It shreds on cutting, doesn't have a high burn point, is very smokey and is useless for building.

Fellis trees
: Fellis is used as an anesthetic on Pern and the leaves of the plant can be steeped and used as a narcotic. In small amounts, it can be combined with numbweed to help kill the pain of Threadscoring.

Ging tree
: grow along side needlethorn bushes. Its sap is a natural glue that can be used to seal wounds. The leaves are very fibrous and are often used to package needthorn from the nearby needlethorn bushes. Interestingly, when Ging tree is in flower, needlethorn is dormant so it acts a physical sign that needlethorn is safe to harvest.  
  
Klah
: A tree-like shrub, its bark is brewed into a coffee-like substance called <i>klah</i>, which tastes like a cross between coffee and hot chocolate with a nutmeg/cinnamon like aftertaste. The bark is also dried and powdered to use as a spice for cooking. 

Needlethorn
: This plant grows cactus like stalks from a single base broadleaf bush, succulent-like, hollow, toxic brown spines. These are only poisonous during spring and summer. It's harvested for its thorns during Autumn and Winter as the thorns make great syringes for injections and to draw blood. 

Numbweed
: This particular variety of flora grows as a bush and is thorny and waxy in feel. The leaves are arrowhead shaped and gray green in colour. It is often made into a salve to numb pain. Making the salve is hard work as it is stewed for three days, slowly strained, and the leftover juices need to be skimmed for the right consistency. Once that happens, the leftovers are often wrapped in cloth and carried to ease scratches on humans and animals. 

Redfruit Tree
: This tree is most noted for its juicy but tart fruit. 

Redwort
: This plant grows in clumps and has thick stems with reddish veins and produces rose-like flowers. Its stems are stewed down into red liquid that is a great scrubbing and cleansing agent, and consequently used by healers to clean wounds and treat infections. As noted in its name, it will leave a red stain on the skin, and has a thick, acidic smell [much like bleach]. Its also great to use if you're working with numbweed as it stops the numbweed from numbing your hands. 

Sticklebush
: have hairline thorns that can and will work their way into skin. Its considered a nuisance weed, although during Autumn it produces tasty berries that used to make jams and preserves.

Skybroom
: This incredibly dense wooded tree grows much like the Old Earth Cedar tree. It has a dense and hard to work wood, but is highly prized. Skybroom trees make wonderful furniture that lasts many, many turns and while it <i>is</i> hard to work, it produces near timeless pieces for sculpture and building. Its root system seems to be resistant to Thread. Many pernese children say that Skybroom trees look like a dragon nestled on its top and flattened it. It also seems to impervious to thread and given its growth it does seem to be true.

Moonflower
: is the name of a climbing vine that grows around Nerat and produces a peach like fruit that is orange-red in color. Its claimed to be very sweet and juicy. Before fruiting, the tree has white circular blossoms that seem to glow during dawn and dusk and is very fragrant.
 
Citron Tree
: Similar to oranges, trees have thorns. water made from the citron flower is a great skin tonic, moisturizes dry skin, aids in the appearance of broken capillaries and seems to lessen the appearance of scars. 

Palms
: Edible, only the heart of the shot. Outer skin is too tough. The heart is said to be crispy, cool, and a bit crunchy.

Pawberry
: Inedible, but if you boil the leaves it makes a beautiful red dye/paint. 

Pink Root
: Found near Southern Boll, this plant is used to treat stomach aches and gastrointestinal issues.  

Plumb
: Can be eaten fresh, dried or made into a jam. Dried plumbs are given for their laxative effect. 

Purple Grass

Bamboo Grasses
: A bamboo like grass, triangular shaped. Can be twisted and braided like wicker for furniture, the young shoots can be cooked and eaten. It also grows very fast.

Black Marshberry

: This is a herb and its flowers can be used in salads and cakes. The leaves add a pleasant flavor to drinks and dips. A leaf and flower infusion can be brewed into a tonic to treat stress, depression, and is often used for steroid treatment. The leaves in powder form can reduce fevers, dry coughs, and aids in treating dry skin as well as aiding in milk flow for both humans and animals.

Often used in hemp bags mixed with barley and bran and put into a bath to help soften and cleanse skin. The flowers produce a nice pure blue dye.
