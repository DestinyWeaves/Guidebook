# Dragons

## Physical

Pern Dragons are <em>different</em>.

Dragons are carnivorous[^carnivorous], oviparous[^oviparous], endothermic[^endothermic] creatures.
Like all of Pern's native large fauna, they are Hexapod.[^hexapod]. Their blood, referred to as ichor, is copper-based and green in colour. 

They had multifaceted[^multifaceted] eyes that changed colour depending on the dragon's mood. Should only some of these facets be damaged, a dragon would still have limited vision in the remaining ones. The head and body shape of a Dragon is closer to that of a horse.

[^carnivorous]: Meat eating.
[^oviparous]: Lays eggs for reproductive purposes.
[^endothermic]: Warm blooded.
[^hexapod]: Four feet, two wings; six limbs total.
[^multifaceted]: Eyes that are similar to flies and cut gems, with multiple lenses/facets.

They had small head-knobs, similar to those of giraffes, and no visible ears. 
Their talons were extremely heat and cold-resistant. Pern dragons traditionally had a smooth hide rather than scales; the texture of their skin was described as being reminiscent of suede with a spicy, sweet scent when clean.

Dragons on Pern have been modified with enhanced mentasynth which increases their telepathic abilities. This was then added into their genetic code that dragons will Impress[^impress] to individuals that dragons feels will most benefit them for oncoming dangers that'll they will face together. 

[^impress]: Bond with mind, body and soul.

<img src="dragonheight" title="6 ft person next to a 15 ft dragon">

The largest a dragon will get is 15 ft from shoulder to the floor. Dragon is measured from standing from the crest of their shoulder to the floor. wing span is measured from wingtip to wingtip at full spread. Dragon length is measured from nose to tail tip with the dragon laying down and stretching out. 

Its noted in canon that due to the triple helix structure of dragons, that dragons didn't have a blood type per say, which allowed for transfusions between different dragons, although its preferred that any transfusion from a dragon should be given one of the same colour. 

Dragon shoulders are built a little different, with their front shoulder joint being more those of dinosaur shoulder, with thick rectangle scapula that sits on the top of the ribcage with more triangular shoulder for the wings sitting over the top. They've got a pronounced clavicle that allows for the ball and socket joint of the wing more range of movement that allows for dragons to fly. 

Dragon bones are also interesting in that aren't as solid as one would think, but instead have a more honey comb structure to reduces weight. This also means that it takes dragons far less time to heal from broken bones than a person. 

### Dragon Colors
The Dragons of the 8th Pass Pern of Destiny Weaves are not the mammoth ‘Jet plane sized’ dragons of Anne McCaffrey’s book of the Ninth Pass. The dragons of the Destiny Weaves are far closer to their  “programmed” sizes as defined by the Geneticist Kitti Ping, so around 10-15 ft tall at the shoulder and around 40-45 ft in length at the longest.

15 ft at the shoulder is considered massive. The way people marvelled at Ramoth’s size is how someone would view 15 ft tall dragon of Destiny Weaves.

#### Naming Conventions for Colors
After the colors hatching during the 6th Pass- often called the ‘Garden Pass” by Harpers for the blossoming of new colors.  Four colors in total hatching the 6th Pass: Rubies, Quartz, Asters and Ixia seemingly with little warning. Rubies & Quartzes- are named after stones with Asters & Ixia being named after flowers.

> Dragons at Destiny Weaves measured from the peak of the shoulder to the ground with the dragon being stood on all fours. Dragon length is measured from nose-tip to tail-tip. Wingspan is measured from wingtip to wingtip.

 
## Dragon Impression, Mating and Reproduction
### Impression

Dragons Impress to people 18 years or older. Dragons haven’t impressed to anyone younger than 18 since the 2nd pass when several riders have mass breakdowns during threadfall.

This has been re-affirmed, with each new pass, the Weyrs unanimously agreed that they would search only people of sufficient maturity both mentally and physically as Pass would see Threadfall. Exposing an immature mind to the rigors and horrors of flying Threadfall &those injuries was determined unsound morality.

> Impression preference does not care about the human's biological sex.

[^nobio]: Impression preference does not care about biological sex.

Dragons do not care about a human’s sexuality or preference, only golds and bronzes have any care about biological gender but that only seems to relate to how the rider sees themselves. <b>Weyrbred folk had a tendency to impress over holdbred.

### Sex and Copulation

In Destiny Weaves, a dragon's defecation isn't in the tail fork but at the base of the tail, with the females having a genital slit on the front of their pelvis. Males also have a slit but have a prehensile penis that allows for copulation during flights, both genders of dragons have their reproductive systems tucked within their bodies to protect them from damage, especially during thread fall. 

So other avenues of mating were attempted but it was found that getting a dragon to mount one another like dogs, was impossible due to the genitals being in the wrong place and having dragons attempt to copulate like people was also deemed dangerous for dragons due to their wings and the spine having elongated processes that functioned as muscle anchor points in the body, as well as a sternum ridge that allows for muscle anchor points on the chest. 

### Mating Flight

When a female comes into estrus, she will show signs of irritability, a warmer-than-usual body temperature, their hide will appear to glow and pulsate before instinct will come into play and have the female want to feed then take flight. It's an accepted thing that riders will mentally fight with their dragon to ensure that they blood their kill, rather than take meat as eating meat would weigh them down and put the dragon at risk of starting to breed and it ending with impact into the ground at high speed.

During a copulation flight, both dragons will stretch their wings out to slow their descent towards the ground so that they can finish mating before needing to split apart. It’s thought that a longer, higher flight means more eggs, with a better color spread.

Gold, Rubies,& Quartz,  dragons Rise in mating flight twice a turn(2x year).

Asters, Ixia & Greens, rise four times a turn ( 4x year).

Note: In Destiny Weaves, all female dragons, except <b>Golds</b> can flame & clutch. Firestone is not a sterilization aid, infact it acts far more like some forms of human birth control- making the female less receptive and pushing their fertile period back abit.

### Clutching

It takes around 3 months from mating before a dragon is ready to lay their clutch on the sands. Dragon Eggs are soft and leathery when laid and around 2 - 3 ft when laid, hardening to their full firmness after 5 weeks on the sands. After a clutch is laid the hatching sands are VERY well lit to ensure the safety of the clutch and anyone on the sands. So generally speaking, it's 4 months from flight to hatchday. 

The clutch outcome is determined by what colour <b>MALE</b> catches the rising female. [Bronze, Ruby, Quartz] have the best chances of producing golds. Golds are only produced by: Bronze, Ruby, and Quartz (Males). 

#### Twins
Dragons do not produce twins often, it’s a 3% percent chance (1d100, roll a 97 or better) using a Twin Chance Token.

#### Exceptions

**Scaled** & **Velvet** are mutually exclusive mutations. You can not breed scaled and velvet together.

**Pearled** & **Bioluminescent** are mutually exclusive mutations. You can not breed Pearled and Bioluminescent together.

Feathers, extra limbs are lethal mutations.

# Specific Colors

## Gold
Golds tend to stick to being mothers, ferociously protective and even territorial with being on the sands and their mates during rising. Like with people, there are shades of grey in personalities, a gold may hatch that has absolutely no interest in being a mother, and in other cases, it may be all the gold wants to do. With this in mind, Golds are well known for going into the hatching sands and pushing other dragons off the sands to take over the clutch as they aren’t capable of producing flame; some golds feel it's their duty to take care of the next generation.

Some of the golds never forgot this, having been around and treated with deference and awe. However, that position of power resulting from the hide has gone for a long time. Thus, golds have found a new purpose as they cannot flame. Some of their jobs have become minding the ill, injured, and eggs. They fly thread falls in the Queens’ wing, which is a low-altitude wing designed mostly for rescues.

Physically, they’re known for being one of the biggest dragons on Pern, [don’t tell Cath that she’s smaller than Pireth, she’ll throw a fit] and tend to garner a lot of attention, especially with the stronger metallic shine to their hides.

Colour
: Golds range from a metallic orange yellow, a rich butter yellow, to a pale straw yellow and down into a yellowed green mustard hue. With such a rich diversity of colour, no two golds will ever be alike.

Size
: 12-15 ft at the shoulder. Rarely, 15 ft.
: 36-45 ft, nose to tail tip.
: 24-30 ft, wingtip to wingtip

Sex
: Female

Impression
: Female[^nobio]

Clutch
: 1-12

## Ruby
Ruby seem to have settled themselves quite firmly between Bronze and Gold. And they are quite happy there, thank you very much. When referred to as “sub-queens”, you’re more likely to get snorted on and get a tail slap for the remark. Although some share very similar traits with Golds, they also can have traits of a bronze. [gender has no bearing here] A ruby is a ruby, and is a ruby. They are not interested in being grouped in with any other color. 

Some feel like their purpose is duty bound to flame thread, others have lioness mother instincts, but ultimately they’ll give way to a gold because they know they can flame thread. 

Physically they reach the same size as gold and bronze. The clutches they lay are the same size as a Gold. It’s also known that Ruby males are perfectly capable of siring gold in their clutches.  

Colour
: The colour of ruby definitely sits very firmly in the red hue. Going from a pale imperial red right along the red range to a dark wine red.

Size
: 10-12 ft at the shoulder. Rarely, 15 ft.
: 30-32 ft, nose to tail tip.
: 20-24 ft, wingtip to wingtip.

Sex
: Any

Impression
: No preference

Clutch
: 1-12

## Bronze
Bronzes, ahhh what can we see about these nobles dragons? They’re not as egotistical as you think. In fact, most tend to be pretty humble, although they’d be the first to dive head first to threadfall to prove their worth. Like all other colors, Bronze vary widely in personality and a generally consistent trait is that if their bonded is being cruel/mean/egostical, the bronze will dump them in the Weyrlake to ‘cool off’. They’re also well known in choosing to ignore their riders for trying to allow their egos to take over. A large number of bronzes are also well known for likin’ their ladies, its a rare thing indeed to see a bronze sticking to only ONE dragon. 

Its also well known that bronzes sire golds, often times more successfully than any other color. In thread, they tend to form the foundation of a wing, being strong steadfast points of reference during fights, with large flame sacs they’re able to both chew more firestone and sustain their flame for longer. 

Colour
: Range from antique bronze to sandy bronze, a golden bronze and darkening to American Bronze. 

Size
: 10-14 ft at the shoulder. Rarely, 15 ft.
: 30-42 ft, nose to tail tip.
: 20-28 ft, wingtip to wingtip.

Sex
: Male

Impression
: Male[^nobio]

Clutch

## Quartz
Quartz dragon’s appeared during the Sixth Pass from Gold Korlith and Bronze Jordith, along with their Ixia siblings.

Male quartz regardless of hue can sire Golds. Darker hues of Quartz, seem to boast better numbers of eggs and gold or ruby daughters. Paler colored quartzwas are no slouches at producing eggs. They seem to have settled themselves in between blue and brown. With the darker quartz being bigger, they tend to have the stamina to last an entire 6 hour fall, whereas the pale quartz are nimble and agile, zipping between the bulk of their bigger brethren and essentially closing the gaps. The females tend to be less interested in mothering a clutch than Golds or Rubies, but will happily tend eggs if the need should arise, but they’re usually more than happy to let a Gold take their clutch. 

### Dark Quartz
Colour
: Ranges from dark charcoal grey to jet black.

Size
: 10-12 ft at the shoulder.
: 30-36 ft, nose to tail tip.

: 24-30 ft, nose to tail tip.
: 16-20 ft, wingtip to wingtip.

## Brown
The workhorse dragon the Weyr. Not as  "powerful" physically as a Bronze or a Gold, in traditional thinking. But they form a necessary backbone, well positioned to both run errands, and fly a full six hour-fall as needed, reliably. 

Browns are an integral part of Weyr’s community. With the ability to hold flame for as long as Bronzes, since puts browns as a much-needed fire force of a wing, and with being more common than bronzes, its makes them an easily accessible part of the workforce. Browns are also known for their stamina and physical strength, given that a lot of bronzes are oft tied down with wing drills, this opens the browns up for being to avail themselves to things outside of threadfall more than bronzes, but not as much as blues, greens and Ixia. Browns being on the larger end of the scale and the stamina to boot, this makes browns great for people and cargo transport. 

Colour
: Ranges from a latte, soft tan, murky khaki and to a chocolate brown. 

Size
: 8-10 ft at the shoulder.
: 24-30 ft, nose to tail tip.
: 16-20 ft, wingtip to wingtip.

Sex
: Male

Impression
: Tends to impress to men more frequently, but will impress women.

Clutch
: N/A

## Aster
A female dragon with bright hues,  usually pink and purple, a bright and colorful dragon. They are most often associated with mind healers as the cheerful colors seem to brighten up most people's day. While not quite enough to fly full fall, they are typically called upon when moving people, and more often goods at least when thread not falling.  They have the stamina to fly long distances, and thus make great long distance messagers.

Otherwise, they are often used as messengers as their bright colors make them easier to spot. 

Aster’s are ‘essentially female browns’. 

With the ability to hold flame for as long as Bronzes, since puts aster in the same league as browns as part of the much-needed fireforce of a wing, and with being more common than bronzes, its makes them an easily accessible part of the workforce. Asters are also known for their stamina and physical strength, given that a lot of bronzes are oft tied down with wing drills, this opens the Asters up for being to avail themselves to things outside of threadfall more than bronzes, but not as much as blues, greens and Ixia. With Asters being on the larger end of the scale and the stamina to boot, this makes browns great for people and cargo transport. 

They will happily babysit eggs, for a short amount of time, but are not usually considered extremely maternal, and thus may keep an eye on a clutch if another clutch minder needs a short break, but are generally not into it for the long haul.

Colour
: Ranges from a candy floss pink to rosewood pink then going to purple hues that go from lilac to raisin purple. Commonly, flashes of both pink and purple to dapple the hides of Asters. 

Size
: 8-10 ft at the shoulder.
: 24-30 ft, nose to tail tip.
: 16-20 ft, wingtip to wingtip.

Sex
: Female

Impression
: Tends to prefer women but will impress to men as well. 

Clutch
: 1-6 eggs

## Blue
Blues are well known for their speed, in threadfall, blues are generally the first ones to make impact in their wing formation. With Blues being so fast, they often utilize the guerilla warfare tactics on thread, hitting it fast then disappearing out of the way whilst the bigger dragons come in.

With speed being synonymous with blues, they make excellent messengers due to their ability to get to places in next to no time, as long as it is close by. Due to being smaller in size, blues lack the stamina of browns, asters and the bigger colors during threadfall. Blues, greens and Ixia will change out during a fight to give them a chance to rest between bouts of flaming and fighting. As blues have higher population density in the Weyrs, it's not uncommon to find older blues being stationed at Holds and Crafthalls. 

Colour
: Ranges from a powder blue to a dark navy. 

Size
: 6-8 ft at the shoulder.
: 18-24 ft, nose to tail tip.
: 12-16 ft, wingtip to wingtip.

Sex
: Male

Impression
: No preference

Clutch
: N/A

## Ixia
Born of the Sixth’s pass surge of ‘new’ colors, these dragons straddle a noticeable line, almost blue & green enough to fall into either category. The Ixia fill an important space between Blues and Greens. They stretch into Blue and Green ranges, a combination of Speed and Agility- they get the best of both worlds although they aren't as good. They’re faster than greens, but not as fast as blue. They’re more agile than blue, but not the same level as a green. They are ultimately used to fill in spaces in Wings, where you may need a blue or a green as they can cover both roles. 

Ixia are often mistaken for blues or greens on first visual inspection, and sometimes ‘masquerade’ as such; and with their numbers sitting between blues and greens, it's a common sight for Hold, Craft and Weyr to see them. As with Greens and Blues, they’re often stationed to Hold and Crafthall in case on emergencies and as a way for people to get around; outside of threadfall of course.


Colour
: Ranges from a pale turquoise to a dark Victorian Ixia

Size
: 6-8 ft at the shoulder.
: 24-30 ft, nose to tail tip.
: 12-16 ft, wingtip to wingtip.

Sex
: Any

Impression
: No preference

Clutch
: 1-6

## Green
Greens are the most numerous dragons in a Weyr, quick [not as quick as blues admittedly] and exceptionally agile, they make the perfect stop gap in a wing formation. With their ability to twist themselves into impossible positions during flight their fighting niche is ‘weave the gap’ between the bigger dragons to stop thread coming through their formation. Greens can and often do serve messengers for Holds and Weyr, although they generally stick to difficult terrain entries with their sense to tuck wing and twist, they’re able to move themselves through what looks to be impossibly tight gaps that would have others hesitating or even refusing to attempt it. 

As greens are very mobile and able to twist themselves into weird and wonderful positions, it's noted that many greenriders have to keep an eye on their dragons to ensure they don’t end up getting stuck [this has yet to happen though], since greens will contort themselves claiming it's comfortable. Greens are perhaps the flashiest flyers in the Weyr, with their movements being mesmerizing to watch. If a hold has a celebration, greens will be the ones doing the overheard ‘displays’ with feats of impossible and amazing feats in the air. 

Colour
: Ranges from a pale tea green to a very dark sacramento green. 

Size
: 6-8 ft at the shoulder.
: 18-24 ft, nose to tail tip.
: 12-16 ft, wingtip to wingtip.
