# Watch-whers of Pern

## Wher physiology
For a while after their creation, Whers were considered a failed dragon experiment. It wasn't until Wind blossoms work was checked that it was found that she attempted to improve upon the design put in place by Kitty Ping, and that the body plan also had some odd linking to their genes. 

With her change to the shoulder, by trying to make both joints more similar to human shoulders, she'd accidentally caused the wing joint to revert back to its primitive design, looking more like the  front shoulder joint in a dragon, whereas the wher front leg had the more 'refined' ball and socket joint system that allowed for both more muscle anchor points and more range of movement. The effect was that wher wings shrunk down and only be usable for gliding rather flying. 

But with the ball socket joint in the front limb, this allowed for more movement range and much heavier muscle. IT was also noted that the changes that Wind Blossom made for stronger bones also increased the weight of the whers so much that sustained flight would be impossible and that if a wher broke a bone it would take longer heal than dragons, although it wasn't as long as people. 

As the first whers were considered incomplete, Wind Blossom tried again, believing that she could revert it back to Kitty Ping's original format, but with a lighting storm having wiped some of the data banks, she was instead stuck with her current format. So she went on trying to modify the format she had, where she had ended up creating the whers are we now know them. The shoulder joints remained as the same as her first attempt, but she modified the feet, adding ridges along the toes, making them both more mobile and having the ridges made it so the whers woul-g the 3rd eyelid a little thicker to act as shade against the sunlight. 

With more mobile toes, the claws were able to be changed to being retractable and making them both harder but less prone to snapping, especially with the original whers being used in the mines to great success. It was the suggestion from the miners that Wind Blossom make them less sun shy and giving them sticky toes to walk up walls to ensure that the whers wouldn't get harmed whilst the miners were moving carts about. 


# Whers/Watchwhers

Pern whers are different.
Whers are carnivorous[^carnivorous], oviparous[^oviparous], endothermic[^endothermic] creatures.

Like all of Pern's native large fauna, they are Hexapod.[^hexapod]. Their blood, referred to as ichor, is copper-based and green in colour. 

They had multifaceted[^multifaceted] eyes that changed colour depending on the dragon's mood. Should only some of these facets be damaged, a dragon would still have limited vision in the remaining ones. The head and body shape of a Dragon is closer to that of a horse.

[^carnivorous]: Meat eating.
[^oviparous]: Lays eggs for reproductive purposes.
[^endothermic]: Warm blooded.
[^hexapod]: Four feet, two wings; six limbs total.
[^multifaceted]: Eyes that are similar to flies and cut gems, with multiple lenses/facets.

<img src="link" title="Dragon eyes">

They had small head-knobs, similar to those of giraffes, and no visible ears. 

Their talons were extremely heat and cold-resistant. Pern dragons traditionally had a smooth hide rather than scales; the texture of their skin was described as being reminiscent of suede with a spicy, sweet scent when clean.

Dragons on Pern have been modified with enhanced mentasynth which increases their telepathic abilities. This was then added into their genetic code that dragons will Impress[^impress] to individuals that dragons feels will most benefit them for oncoming dangers that'll they will face together. 

[^impress]: Bond with mind, body and soul.

<img src="dragonheight" title="6 ft person next to a 15 ft dragon">

The largest a wher will get is 10 ft from shoulder to the floor. Dragon is measured from standing from the crest of their shoulder to the floor. wing span is measured from wingtip to wingtip at full spread. Dragon length is measured from nose to tail tip with the dragon laying down and stretching out. 

Its noted in canon that due to the triple helix structure of dragons, that dragons didn't have a blood type per say, which allowed for transfusions between different dragons, although its preferred that any transfusion from a dragon should be given one of the same colour. 

Dragon shoulders are built a little different, with their front shoulder joint being more those of dinosaur shoulder, with thick rectangle scapula that sits on the top of the ribcage with more triangular shoulder for the wings sitting over the top. They've got a pronounced clavicle that allows for the ball and socket joint of the wing more range of movement that allows for dragons to fly. 

Dragon bones are also interesting in that aren't as solid as one would think, but instead have a more honey comb structure to reduces weight. This also means that it takes dragons far less time to heal from broken bones than a person. 

## Dragon Colors

The Dragons of the 8th Pass Pern of Destiny Weaves are not the mammoth ‘Jet plane sized’ dragons of Anne McCaffrey’s book of the Ninth Pass. The dragons of the Destiny Weaves are far closer to their  “programmed” sizes as defined by the Geneticist Kitti Ping, so around 10-15 ft tall at the shoulder and around 40-45 ft in length at the longest.

15 ft at the shoulder is considered massive. The way people marvelled at Ramoth’s size is how someone would view 15 ft tall dragon of Destiny Weaves.

Note: Dragons at Destiny Weaves measured from the peak of the shoulder to the ground with the dragon being stood on all fours. Dragon length is measured from nose-tip to tail-tip. Wingspan is measured from wingtip to wingtip.

Whers tend to prefer Holdfolk when bonding. 

## Sex and Copulation

### Mating flight
When a female comes into estrus, she will show signs of irritability, a warmer than usual body temperature, their hide will appear to glow and pulsate before instinct will come into play and have the female want to feed then run. It's an accepted thing that handlers will mentally fight with their wher to ensure that they blood their kill, rather than take meat as eating meat would weigh them down and put the wher at risk of starting to breed earlier before she’d had chance to really get going.

### Clutching

It takes around 3 months from mating before a wher is ready to lay their clutch on the sands. Wher Eggs are soft and leathery when laid and around 2 - 3 ft when laid, hardening to their full firmness after 5 weeks on the sands. After a clutch is laid the hatching sands are VERY well lit to ensure the safety of the clutch and anyone on the sands. So generally speaking, it's 4 months from flight to hatchday. 

The clutch outcome is determined by what colour **MALE** catches the rising female. [Bronze, Ruby, Quartz] have the best chances of producing golds. Golds are only produced by: Bronze, Ruby, and Quartz (Males). 

#### Exceptions

**Scaled** & **Velvet** are mutually exclusive mutations. You can not breed scaled and velvet together.

**Pearled** & **Bioluminescent** are mutually exclusive mutations. You can not breed Pearled and Bioluminescent together.

Feathers, extra limbs are lethal mutations.

# Specific Colors

## Gold
Golds tend to stick to being mothers, ferociously protective and even territorial with being on the sands and their mates during rising. Like with people, there are shades of grey in personalities, a gold may hatch that has absolutely no interest in being a mother, and in other cases, it may be all the gold wants to do. With this in mind, Golds are well known for going into the hatching sands and pushing other dragons off the sands to take over the clutch as they aren’t capable of producing flame; some golds feel it's their duty to take care of the next generation.

Like people they like to stick with their own colors, having been around and treated with deference and awe, some of the golds never forgot this but that power position from their hide has gone for a long time.  

Physically, they’re known for being one of the biggest dragons on Pern, [don’t tell Cath that she’s smaller than Pireth, she’ll throw a fit] tends to garner a lot of attention, especially with the metallic shine to their hides.

Colour
: Golds range from a metallic orange yellow, a rich butter yellow, to a pale straw yellow and down into a yellowed green mustard hue. With such a rich diversity of colour no two golds will ever be alike.

Size
: 6-8 ft at the shoulder.  Rarely, up to 8 ft.
: 9-12 ft, nose to tail tip.
: 6-8 ft, wingtip to wingtip.

Sex
: Female

Impression

Clutch size
: 1-12


## Ruby
Ruby seem to have settled themselves quite firmly between Bronze and Gold. And they are quite happy there, thank you very much. When referred to a sub-queens, you’re more likely to get snorted on and get a tail slap for the remark. Although some share very similar traits with Golds, they also can have traits of a bronze. [gender has no bearing here] A ruby is a ruby, and is a ruby. They’ve no interested in being grouped in with any other color. 

Some feel like their purpose is duty bound to flame thread, others have lioness mother instincts, but ultimately they’ll give way to a gold because they know they can flame thread. 

Physically they reach a size just under gold and bronze, but it's not uncommon for a ruby to dip into those sizes.  The clutches they lay are almost the same size as a Gold. It’s also known that Ruby males are perfectly capable of siring gold in their clutches.

Colour
: The colour of ruby definitely sits very firmly in the red hue. Going from a pale imperial red right along the red range to a dark wine red.

Size
: 6-8 ft at the shoulder. Rarely, up to 15 ft.
: 9-12 ft, nose to tail tip.
: 6-8 ft, wingtip to wingtip.

## Bronze
Bronzes, ahhh what can we see about these noble's dragons? They’re not as egotistical as you think. In fact, most tend to be pretty humble, although they’d be the first to dive head first to threadfall to prove their worth. Like all other colors, Bronze vary widely in personality and a generally consistent trait is that if their bonded is being cruel/mean/egostical, the bronze will dump them in the Weyrlake to ‘cool off’. They’re also well known in choosing to ignore their riders for trying to allow their egos to take over. A large number of bronzes are also well known for likin’ their ladies, its a rare thing indeed to see a bronze sticking to only ONE dragon. 

Its also well known that bronzes sire golds, often times more successfully than any other color. In thread, they tend to form the foundation of a wing, being strong steadfast points of reference during fights, with large flame sacs they’re able to both chew more firestone and sustain their flame for longer. 

Colour
: Range from antique bronze to sandy bronze, a golden bronze and darkening to American Bronze. 

Size
: 6-8 ft at the shoulder.
: 9-12 ft, nose to tail tip.
: 6-8 ft, wingtip to wingtip.

Sex

## Quartz
Quartz dragon’s appeared during the Sixth Pass from Gold Korlith and Bronze Jordith. Along with their teal siblings.

Male quartz regardless of hue are able to sire Golds but it is the darker hue of Quartz that boat the better numbers. They seem to have settled themselves in between blue and brown. With the darker quartz being bigger, they tend to have the stamina to last an entire 6 hour fall, whereas the pale quartz are nimble and agile, zipping between the bulk of their bigger brethren and essentially closing the gaps. The females tend to be less interested in mothering a clutch than Golds or Rubies, but will happily tend eggs if the need should arise, but they’re usually more than happy to let a Gold take their clutch. 

### Dark Quartz

## Brown
The workhorse dragon the Weyr. Not as  "powerful" physically as a Bronze or a Gold, in traditional thinking. But they form a necessary backbone, well positioned to both run errands, and fly a full  six hour-fall as needed, reliably. 

Browns are an integral part of Weyr’s community. With the ability to hold flame for as long as Bronzes, since puts browns as a much needed fireforce of a wing, and with being more common than bronzes, its makes them an easily accessible part of the workforce. Browns are also known for their stamina and physical strength, given that a lot of bronzes are oft tied down with wing drills, this opens the browns up for being to avail themselves to things outside of threadfall more than bronzes, but not as much as blues, greens and teals. With browns being on the larger end of the scale and the stamina to boot, this makes browns great for people and cargo transport.

Colour
: Ranges from a latte, soft tan, murky khaki and to a chocolate brown. 

Size
: 4-6 ft at the shoulder.
: 8-10 ft, nose to tail tip.
: 4-6 ft, wingtip to wingtip.

Sex
: Male

Impression
: Tends to impress to men more, but will impress women.[^nobio]

Clutch

## Aster
A female wher with bright hues,  usually pink and purple, a bright and colorful wher. They are most often associated with  mind healers as the cheerful colors seem to brighten up most people's day. While not quite enough to fly full fall, they are typically called upon when moving people, and more often goods at least when thread not falling.  They have the stamina to fly long distances, and thus make great long distance messagers.

Otherwise, they are often used as messengers as their bright colors make them easier to spot. 

Aster’s are ‘essentially female browns’. 

With the ability to hold flame for as long as Bronzes, since puts aster in the same league as browns as part of the much-needed fireforce of a wing, and with being more common than bronzes, its makes them an easily accessible part of the workforce. Asters are also known for their stamina and physical strength, given that a lot of bronzes are oft tied down with wing drills, this opens the Asters up for being to avail themselves to things outside of threadfall more than bronzes, but not as much as blues, greens and teals. With Asters being on the larger end of the scale and the stamina to boot, this makes browns great for people and cargo transport. 

They will happily babysit eggs, for a short amount of time, but are not usually considered extremely maternal, and thus may keep an eye on a clutch if another clutch minder needs a short break, but are generally not into it for the long haul.

Colour
: Ranges from a candy floss pink to rosewood pink then going to purple hues that go from lilac to raisin purple. Commonly, flashes of both pink and purple to dapple the hides of Asters. 

Size
: 4-6 ft at the shoulder.
: 8-12 ft, nose to tail tip.
: 4-6 ft, wingtip to wingtip.

Sex
: Female

Impression
: Tends to prefer women but will impress to men as well.[^nobio]

Clutch
: 1-6 eggs

## Blue
Blues are well known for their speed, in threadfall, blues are generally the first ones to make impact in their wing formation. With Blues being so fast, they often utilize the guerilla warfare tactics on thread, hitting it fast then disappearing out of the way whilst the bigger dragons come in.

With speed being synonymous with blues, they make excellent messengers due to their ability to get to places in next to no time, as long as it is close by. Due to being smaller in size, blues lack the stamina of browns, asters and the bigger colors during threadfall. Blues, greens and teals will change out during a fight to give them a chance to rest between bouts of flaming and fighting. As blues have higher population density in the Weyrs, it's not uncommon to find older blues being stationed at Holds and Crafthalls.

Colour
: Ranges from a powder blue to a dark navy. 

Size
: 6-8 ft at the shoulder.
: 18-24 ft, nose to tail tip.
: 12-16 ft, wingtip to wingtip.

Sex
: Male

## Green
Greens are the most numerous dragons in a Weyr, quick [not as quick as blues admittedly] and exceptionally agile, they make the perfect stop gap in a wing formation. With their ability to twist themselves into impossible positions during flight their fighting niche is ‘weave the gap’ between the bigger dragons to stop thread coming through their formation. Greens can and often do serve messengers for Holds and Weyr, although they generally stick to difficult terrain entries with their sense to tuck wing and twist, they’re able to move themselves through what looks to be impossibly tight gaps that would have others hesitating or even refusing to attempt it. 

As greens are very mobile and able to twist themselves into weird and wonderful positions, it's noted that many greenriders have to keep an eye on their dragons to ensure they don’t end up getting stuck [this has yet to happen though], since greens will contort themselves claiming it's comfortable. Greens are perhaps the flashiest flyers in the Weyr, with their movements being mesmerizing to watch. If a hold has a celebration, greens will be the ones doing the overheard ‘displays’ with feats of impossible and amazing feats in the air. 

Colour
: Ranges from a pale tea green to a very dark sacramento green. 

Size
: 6-8 ft at the shoulder.
: 18-24 ft, nose to tail tip.
: 12-16 ft, wingtip to wingtip.

Sex
: Female

## Teal
Born of the Sixth’s pass surge of ‘new’ colors, these dragons straddle a noticeable line, almost blue & green enough to fall into either category. The Teals fill an important space between Blues and Greens. They stretch into Blue and Green ranges, a combination of Speed and Agility- they get the best of both worlds although they aren't as good. They’re faster than greens, but not as fast as blue. They’re more agile than blue, but not the same level as a green. They are ultimately used to fill in spaces in Wings, where you may need a blue or a green as they can cover both roles. 

Teals are often mistaken for blues or greens on first visual inspection, and sometimes ‘masquerade’ as such; and with their numbers sitting between blues and greens, it's a common sight for Hold, Craft and Weyr to see them. As with Greens and Blues, they’re often stationed to Hold and Crafthall in case on emergencies and as a way for people to get around; outside of threadfall of course.
