# Native Fauna of Pern
Here's you'll find a list and brief description of the native animals, insects, and fish that live and thrive on Pern.

### Avian

Wherries
: These large birdlike creatures are a native avian species of the planet Pern. So named by the Exploration and Evaluation Corps team for their airborne barge-like shape. They are squat, fat, and full. And quite similar to the vessels that were used to ferry stuff between the English Isle and the European Continent on ancient Earth. Wherries are particularly aggressive carnivores and posess six limbs, like many other Pernese creatures. They have two wings, four legs, and have downy tufts of proto-feathers covering membranous wings. They turn incredibly aggressive if one of their kind is hurt. Males are called bucks and females are called hens. There are two types of wherries found on Pern -- inland and seaside -- the sea side ones have a fishlike taste and have a large layer of fat just below their skin which is good for making oil to soothe fire lizard and dragon hide. 

Furbeasts
: These small mammals are usually trapped for their fur and meat. They’re not really separated by name or by their characteristics, so hopping furbeasts are rabbits, slinky furbeasts are similar to minks, squeaky furbeasts are considered a cross between a squirrel and mouse. 
 
Whersports
: Look like a cross between Firelizards and Whers, but smaller than Wher and bigger than firelizard. No bonding ability. Lives in herds of 2-16, harem like. Hunted for its hide, but is considered lesser quality than actual Watch-wher hide but costs far less.

### Bugs and Insects
Tunnelsnakes/Sandsnakes/Watersnakes
: Cold blooded, reptilian creatures with six limbs. Some species’ bites are more venomous than others, but most aren't particularly dangerous. 

Vetols
: (VTOLs) So named by the Exploration team because of their ability to take off from the ground much like Terran helicopters, these insects are usually iridescent, much like dragonflies. 

Grubs
: This famous thread fighting species of grub is found in the Southern Continent with transplanted grubs now living in the Northern and Western Continents. Some variations have a furry coat to protect them in harsh climes but spend the majority of their time among the forests and contribute to the health of their ecosystem but tilling the soil, and of course, gobbling up Thread when it falls. 

Crawlies
: What is a world without cockroaches? These guys are tough to eradicate and protein filled. 

Trundlebugs
: Beetle-like pollinators, known to churn soil. 

Flybys
: Pernese biting gnats with a particularly startling bite. Known to cling to runners and other forms of herdbeast. 

Rockmites
: Rockmites are a form of water bug that lives in and around coastlines, swampy areas, and places of heavy moisture. 

Rollers
: Pernese version of a woodlouse. 

Scatid
: These burrowing insects are a pest but also help to keep the soil fertile. They tend to come to the surface when they sight prey - other insects, carrion, etc. and help break down organic sources into the right fertilizer. 

Wrigglers
: The soil enriching invertebrates we know as worms. 

Sandworm
: An armored species of worm that lives near Igen Hold in the desert.

### Fish and Marine Animals

Bordo
: River variant of a packtail. 

Packtail
: Deep sea fish, with a thick slime coat known to cause infection if slime gets into an open wound. 

Redfin
: Well sized fish, think a cross between Salmon and Tuna.  

Yellow-stripe
: A medium sized fish, tastes like mackerel. 

Whitefish
: Known to be utterly delicious! Regularly eaten on the coast. Tastes great either fresh, salted, smoked or pickled.  

Fingertail
: An  anchovy like fish, so named for their finger-thin slimness. 

Spiderclaw
: A variation of Pernese crab.  

Deep Ones
: Pernese whales that make a low moaning noise when they come to surface. One can often tell its coming to the surface by the mass bubbles that come up before they do. They are wonderfully empathic but not truly telepathic.
