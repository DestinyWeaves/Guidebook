# Imported Fauna of Pern

When the first colonists came to Pern, they brought a number of animals with them, mostly livestock. This is a brief overview of the animals that surfived to present day. 

Herdbeast
: Stocky, hairy cattle.  

Porcine
: Pigs. <i>Mmmâ€¦bacon.</i> Smart little creatures used for hunting truffles <i>and</i> tasty feasts. 

Woolies/Ovines
: Sheep known for their thick wooly coat which is turned into wool yarn and a main staple for the Weaving Craft to make into clothing. 

Woolbeast
: Llamas and alpacas, used for very fine spun wool such as cashmere and fine-spun woll that is less itchy. 

Runnerbeast/Runners
: Horses, which come in many beautiful shades of colour. 

Draybeast
: Oxen/bison cross.  

Shipfish
: Dolphins. 

Cheetahs
: Large dark spotted felines that were released into the wild due to colonist and would-be geneticist Ted Tubberman's experimentation with metasynth in the early colony days of Pern. They hunt in prides and are some of the fiercest predators on the Southern continent.  

Mrreows
: Small felines that hunt tunnelsnakes. They were found on the Western continent and brought over to the Northern continent due to their natural hunting instinct and specifically because they were excellent at hunting various kinds of tunnelsnake. 

Hounds
: Dogs in all shapes and sizes. Especially useful are small work dogs who help run the kitchen's roating turns.
