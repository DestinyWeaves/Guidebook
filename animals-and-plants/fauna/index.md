# Fauna of Pern

The animals that live on Pern are vast and varied, so to help you out, we’ve put together two sections of imported and native fauna.

As any good colony expedition force ought to do, the colonist brought a whole ecosystem with them with adaptations made so that the species could graze and feed on native flora as well as hybrid species of flora strengthened over turns of cultivation. In the two thousand turns since the initial colonisation, the planet itself has become an active and thriving space for the basics of Ancient Earth fauna to have adapted and thrived under the conditions that Rukbat, the system’s primary star, provides. In these pages, you’ll find the details on what fauna are for what resource and how they nourish the Pernese.
