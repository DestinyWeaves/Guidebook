# Firelizards and Flits of Pern

colors, training, craft links, detailllsss

## The Basics

Pernese Firelizards are the original life form discovered by the colonists 1 AL (After Landing) at the initial colonization site. A few impressions and mishaps(due to threadfall), people realized they were useful and intelligent and that improving them with a little genetic engineering would make them even more useful.

 They are what dragons are based on, with some modifications\[Better intelligence, full mentasynth access, size increases, and bit more genetic tinkering\].

 Firelizards are smaller and they are empathic, ‘talking’ with pictures and emotions, rather than words.   
Before dragons were created  they practiced on Firelizards which improved:

* Mentasyth  
* Size  
* Some Intelligence  
* Extra toes (Five on the front ‘hands’, instead of the tridactyl claws.)  
    
  These changes mean that ‘dragonets’ the original firelizards are truely extinct as they were out-competed by their improved ‘cousins’.

## Impression

Firelizards unlike dragons or a lesser extent whers, do not care whom they impress. Their first thought is survival, so food is the primary objective once they are out of the egg. Offer them food and they are bonded pretty quickly.

In the wild, it seems fire-lizards will upon hatching ‘impress’ their Fair’s ( a group of firelizards) current Queen, but that seems to be somewhat erroneous, as fire lizards passing away due to accident or illness does not cause the entire fair to between.   Most Harpers and Dragonhealers surmise that a firelizard’s impression is closer to that of wher’s than a dragons.  Firelizards do not need humanity to live. Even after impressing is the human dies, then the firelizard may more often then not ‘go wild’.

## Intelligence

Firelizards are like smart cats, or smart two year-olds. They playful and spiteful and more cat like than more people give them credit for, but they can learn to fetch and carry, and ferry messages like a carrier pigeon \- with much better results.

## olors & Sizes

 Firelizard Wings spans are twice the length of the body. Firelizards are as intelligent as a smart livestock herding hound. Like their bigger cousins, stereotypes exist, but most people don’t think about them as much.

Dragons save Pern.  
Whers are useful in the Mines and for nightwatch.  
Firelizards are useful messengers and pets.

Gold (f) & Bronze(m), Ruby(F/m) \- vary in size between (30-34inches/76-86 cms) and around 2-3 lbs.

Quartz (f/m) Aster(f) &/Brown(m) \- are 18-20 Inches Long, and around 1-2lbs

Blue(m), Ixia l(f/m), Green(f) are somewhere between 14 to 17 inches.  
 

History  
During Pern’s 6th Interval, firelizards seemed to disappear with the illness that plagued dragons, humans and runners alike. The Firelizards were to most people dangerous pests. This manifested in many people pushing their firelizards away. Firelizards unlike dragons \- do not need a human bond to live.  Wild firelizards- those unbonded by humans- are common and during the plague of the Sixth Pass, they seemed to retreat into the wildest places- wherever humans seemed unable to venture. 

A few folks found clutches, raised them after the plague was ended, and even inoculated their firelizards,  thus current populations are far less susceptible to that particular issue.  It was noticeably that in the Firelizard populations saw the rise more swift of : Rubies, Quartz, Asters and Ixia.

The Healer Hall, and it’s dragon healing students proposed an idea: that caught on like firehead fever- if someone wanted a firelizard- they should need to have it trained.

Plenty of firelizards had poor manners: stealing items that caught their attention- rings, food, pieces of toys for children, bells, crafting supplies- it was chaos.  
 The DragonHealers set out to create a new idea- Firelizard training- for both humans and firelizards and marking owned fire lizards with a sash/band of woven cloth, simply to help keep track of which firelizard belonged potentially to whom.

This came into play when a firelizard, became sick or injured and need medical attention, a trained firelizard would be able to present themselves for examination.

## Training

Training a firelizard  is similar to training a hound. Positive reinforcement gets you the best results. Reward the good actions, the things you want, and ignore the bad, or correct them instantly- the moment they happen so the association is strong.  
Firelizards-owners are cautioned to make training interesting for the firelizard, recall training becomes a game- that sort of thing. And once the training is in place it needs to be refreshed, often. Weekly training sessions with a firelizard are recommended.

Message Harnesses are common places on firelizard with messenger training- who have been trained. Message Harnesses are essentially a version of ‘a dragon riding strap in miniature.
