# How to sign up

How to sign up on the site and discord

Signing on the site, much easier than you think. In the top left hand of the site, you’ll see a wide bar that stretches across the top of the site. There are two buttons, Register and Login. 

Click register and follow the onscreen instructions to complete your Main account. 

To register for the discord channel, at the bottom of the Guidebook navigation bar, you’ll see the Discord link, if you click there it will take you directly to our discord channel.  

# How to create your first character

So unlike other sites, we have a sub-account system for characters. All characters are to be linked directly to a player account so it makes easier for you to switch between characters depending on what you are doing. You ‘ll find a lot of players will sit in their player account and only switch over when they know they have replies to do for a certain character. 

On the top bar, the same as where you saw the register and login buttons. You’ll see a toothed gear icon. Click on that and scroll down until you see an ‘EDIT SUB-ACCOUNT’ link. Click on that link. 

There you’ll see a table where ‘username’ and registered’ information will be kept, and just below that are ‘Delink account’ and ‘Register a new account’ buttons. Click the Register new account button. 

Once you’ve done this, you’ll be greeted with a ‘Terms and Conditions’ page, in order to continue please read and click the checkbox to accept to get on the next step. A page will load up that looks exactly like the page when you first registered to the site. Please fill out the relevant information for your character then click

# Custom Dragonspeech Codes

Users who wish to have a custom dragonspeech format may request it. This can include a gradient background or other similar features. Users are specifically encouraged to request a format code instead of hardcoding a format by other means.

To Request this, please either post in the discord channel `#attn-staff`, or you can go to [Here](linkhere) and use the provided form in that post to send in your request.

In order to ensure that your dragonspeech code works with the accessibility-mode toggle enabled, also include accessibility-mode colors in your request — that is, a foreground and background color for each of light and dark mode.  
Accessibility mode is specifically designed to ensure that posts are readable to *all*, even those with nonstandard vision, dyslexia, or other impairments. Note though, **accessibility is usability**: a significant fraction of this site uses this mode simply to avoid eye strain or visual discomfort.  

In order to accomplish this, there are defined rules about what color combinations can be accepted. A technical definition is given below, but in practice that definition boils down to “dark text on a pastel background” in light-mode and “light text on a dark tinted background” in dark mode.  
The accessibility-mode colors selected MUST confirm to the WebAIM WCAG color contrast guidelines, with a minimum 7:1 contrast ratio between foreground and background and a maximum of 2:1 contrast ratio between the text background and site background. (Ideally, select colors that give around 8:1 and 1.5:1 respectively, and use fully desaturated grays for foreground.) You can verify a particular color choice meets accessibility guidelines with [this tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). Staff reserves the right to edit accessibility-mode colors to bring them in line with these accessibility-mode requirements.
