Pern’s official canon does not go into depth on how its laws work; therefore, for Destiny Weaves specifically...

## Blackletter

Pern does not have a system of blackletter law: that is, there is no unified concept of a legislature capable of specifically establishing that certain acts are offenses (criminal or otherwise), and the few blackletter laws that do exist are not considered exhaustive. What is or isn’t an offense is governed by tradition, precedent, and the individual discretion of the courts that judge it.

## Property

A Lord Holder has allodial title to their hold and all property in it, but the tradition of tithes grants individual holders specific property rights to their traditional family dwellings and to their chattels that can in some cases supercede this.

When holders marry, all property of both individuals becomes held in common between them as property of the marriage: i.e. owned not just by the couple but also by any children between them. Even if a couple separates, the marriage as a legal corporation continues to exist to give their children title to their parent’s property. Most holder couples don’t get married until after they are sharing a household or until they expect a child — being ‘married’ is distinct from being ‘wed’, with the former being a formality taken as the “responsible” way to guarantee each side’s ownership of their household and obligation to their children, and the latter being a cultural recognition of a couple’s commitment to each other.

Members of a craft are considered to have property rights to the tools and instruments of their craft, independent of other rights — when a craftsperson is indentured for a debt, their tools go with them: they cannot be seized and sold to satisfy a debt unless it can be established that a particular tool is “unnecessary and excessive” for the individual’s practice of their craft.

Within a weyr, riders and candidates do not have traditional property rights in quite the same sense as holders. Each rider instead has a “commission” granted to them by the weyr, granting them stewardship over resources they are meant to use to further the weyr’s mission. In practice, this also means ‘owning’ their own personal property and being able to use and spend it freely, but a weyr *can* impose restrictions on things in ways that would run afoul of holder traditional property (e.g. disallowing gambling, personally-owned alcohol, or the like).

Riders may also have craft property rights independent of their commission, but in practice that is a distinction that doesn’t tend to matter in a weyr. Riders also don’t marry, as commissions can’t be held in common the way traditional holder property rights can.

## Tort Law

Crime in the modern understanding of the word doesn’t exist as a concept, except within a weyr courts-martial. Rather, almost all offenses are thought of as *torts* — even things like murder.

A tort isn’t an offense against the state, but rather against an individual victim (the **claimant**), and it’s the claimant’s responsibility to prosecute their tort case by petitioning their lord for aid (whether directly or indirectly). A tort has a finite monetary value associated with it (the **bote**, or **tortbote**), and while an individual who committed the tort (the **tortfeasor**) might dispute the amount of the bote even if they admit to committed the tort, their entire responsibility for the tort is discharged if they pay the claimant that amount.

Only a tortfeasor who is insolvent and unable to pay is then ‘punished’ in some further sense: most often this takes the form of indentured servitude for the remaining debt, but a lord may deem it appropriate to make an example of someone (either instead of or in addition to indenture).

Certain offenses invoke the idea of a **manbote**, as distinct from an ordinary tortbote; this can be thought of as concept somewhere between “strict liability” and “actual damages” in modern law, with a manbote but not an ordinary tortbote still being owed to a claimant even if the tortfeasor raises certain defenses.

### Specific Offenses

This list of offenses is not exhaustive or authoritative. What torts are recognised in a given hold is a matter of local tradition — this list just gives some common examples.

#### Perjury

In Pern, one’s word is one’s bond, and breaking a promise or telling a lie can be a serious matter even when no direct harm was caused. The bote for tort perjury is considered to be *in addition* to any value needed to settle the actual harm caused (such as the value of goods or payment not conveyed as contracted, or the price associated with an injury).

#### Malediction

When someone directs a curse or insult toward another, especially of higher social rank or one which is particularly heinous or unjustified in context, they commit malediction. The tortbote for malediction isn’t especially large and some holds don’t recognise malediction as a separate tort that can be claimed separate from another more serious tort, but this is often raised as a counterclaim to reduce another bote for the likely violence these words may have provoked. 

#### Assault

When someone draw a weapon or makes another clear move to attack another, they commit assault — even if their inexpert swings fai to connect before their buddies stop you. The tortbote for assault (when not combined with battery) is often comparable to malediction.

#### Battery

When someone strike another, whether with a fist, weapon, or open hand, they commit battery. The tortbote for battery does depend on the severity of the strike and also depend on the social rank of the person you struck.

#### Mayhem

When someone causes a serious injury to or draws blood from another, they commit mayhem. Mayhem that leaves the victim crippled or disfigured can invoke a manbote calculated as a percentage of manslaughter, otherwise it’s satisfied with an ordinary tortbote.

#### Alienation

When someone has sex with a married holder woman or man other than their own spouse, they commit alienation. This is a tort against a marriage, i.e. them, their spouse, and their children as a collective. The tortbote for alienation depends significantly on circumstance.

#### Seduction

When a man has sex with a holder woman other than his wife or fiancee, and she becomes pregnant as a result, he commits seduction. Tort seduction involves a manbote, calculated in relation to a hypothetical manbote for a plausible father figure for the child.

#### Rape

When someone has sex with another who expressly or implicitly does not consent, they commit rape. Rape is a ‘simple’ tort with only a tortbote, but the tortbote is often much higher than other ‘simple’ torts.

#### Manslaughter

Given that the principle victim of manslaughter is definitionally dead and unable to prosecute, manslaughter is usually thought of instead as a tort against their family and lord, who are deprived of a person they previously relied on to support them or to pay tithe. A manbote is therefore owed based on the social value of the person killed.

Pernese law doesn’t specifically distinguish between manslaughter and murder as such — regardless of how ‘justified’ a killing was, a manbote *must* always be paid.

### Defenses

#### Superiority

A superior who appropriately chastises, castigates, or punishes his inferior, owes no tortbote even if this caused offense. “Appropriately” is key to a defense of superiority, though: tortbote is still owed for most acts that are egregious enough to be raised in court, and manbote is always owed regardless.

#### Provocation

Provocation means that the claimant themselves committed an offense that led the tortfeasor to escalate to the point of the claimed offense. This is not a rare claim; if proven, often some multiple of a counter-claimed tortbote is deducted from the initial tortbote (though *what* multiple is usually a matter of  discretion for the court judging a claim).

#### Defense of Another

When someone calls for aid and another comes to their defense, the defended party who called for or needed aid shares some fraction of the responsibility to pay bote for any reasonable acts taken by the defender to defend them.

#### Self Defense

A hold’s lord is the ultimate authority responsible for protecting his subject, and he satisfies his oath to do so by authorizing those subjects to act on his behalf in their own defense. I.e. self defense is thought of as essentially the same as defense of another, but with the lord holder paying the portion of bote owed by the defended party.

#### Mutual Combat

Not all duels are legal, but the core feature that *makes* a duel legal is an agreement that negates any tortbote, and the existence of sponsors who have agreed to pay manbote for any death or injury caused in the duel.

## Equity Law

Tort Law is the basic foundation of pern’s legal system: it’s what a holder can demand when they are wronged, and a standard they can demand to not be penalized more harshly than — part of the traditional rights that holders have. However, tort law can be very inflexible; Equity Law exists to address that weakness.

**Equity Law does not apply in all cases — only when both parties consent.** The procedural mechanism for this is discussed later.

### Principles

Equity Law establishes a set of guiding principles that a judge is meant to apply to craft a decision.

#### Restitution

Restitution means trying to directly undo damage that was done. Tort Law provides for monetary restitution, but Equity Law tells a judge that money can’t fix everything, blood can’t be drawn from a stone, and in many cases it’s better to compromise on restitution in favor of other forms of equity.

#### Rehabilitation

Rehabilitation means solving an underlying social or economic situation that led someone to commit an offense. Tort Law provides for rehabilitation only in the sense that the cost of a tortbote may be painful enough to convince someone to not repeat an offense, but Equity Law tells a judge that this may make a problem *worse* rather than better, and to recommend a more comprehensive approach involving mindhealing or resolving an underlying economic hardship.

#### Reminder

Reminder means punishing someone publicly in a way that will deter others from doing the same. Tort Law can make an example of someone, but Equity Law tells a judge that shame is every bit as important as pain, and to favor punishments that can be publicly seen and easily understood.

#### Removal

Removal means physically preventing an offender from continuing to commit an offense. Tort Law *might* bankrupt someone *eventually*, and put a stop to them that way; but Equity Law tells a judge that society can’t always afford to wait, and measures to prevent a repeated crime need to be taken *whenever* there’s a risk of a repeat.

#### Retribution

Retribution means punishing someone in a way that feels “worth” the offense they committed to those who were hurt by it. Tort Law sets a monetary value based on the amount of harm caused by an offense, but Equity Law tells a judge that retribution is not served when a wealthy individual pays a bote too small to cause them hardship, and that social humiliation or physical pain can be far more effective.

#### Retaliation

Retaliation means following the base instincts that wish to see someone who harmed you harmed in turn. Tort law can starve an offender to death, but Equity Law tells a judge that these instincts should be tempered with mercy, and to find less permanent harms that a victim can be satisfied by.

# Courts

Readers from the modern anglosphere are likely familiar with the idea of a “court” as the place where one defends or is prosecuted with a civil lawsuit or a crime; they may also be familiar with the idea of a “royal court” and “courtiers”. As meant here, a court is the underlying idea that unifies those and several other ideas: it’s an institution where individuals are able to petition a government to exercise power in some way.

As applied to torts, the petition a claimant will submit bears a lot of resemblance to a modern lawsuit, but the procedural mechanisms for how those petitions are handled are very different in some places.

## Courts of a Lord Holder

The courts most relevant to day-to-day life for most of Pern who live within holds are the various courts of their local Lord Holder. Even for petitions that extend beyond the bounds of a single hold, this is *usually* the first step.

There are several distinct types of sessions that can be held in the court of a Lord holder, with the most important distinction being who is ‘admitted’ and allowed to petition within a session.

### Court Real

Court Real is a court where issues are tried by the Lord Holder directly, most often as an administrative meeting between the Lord Holder and any leadership he has appointed under him, but sometimes as an emergency session when an issue requires immediate decisions.

In general, it’s considered good form for a Lord holding Court Real to render only judgements within that administrative scope; such as instructing leaders to do certain things, or for things that require immediate action to stop some imminent danger, such as coordinating a disaster response. Anything else that *can* wait for a later scheduled session of Court Major, *should* be.

### Court Major

Court Major is regularly-scheduled court session where the Lord Holder is physically present — and outside those specifically summoned to it, only courtiers are usually admitted to petition in Court Major; i.e. Riders, Lords of other holds, Masters of a craft, Harpers, and in some cases other community representatives like clan matriarchs or patriarchs from major clans within a hold.

In large holds, Court Major is held with some regularity — sometimes three times a week for the largest — but for smaller holds whose Lord Holder doesn’t have permanent magistrate judges, Court Major is held following the schedule of a traveling circuit of magistrates usually appointed by Harperhall.

During Court Major, the Lord Holder is the one to preside over his court and render judgment, but he does not ordinarily try the petitions himself. Rather, petitions are tried by a panel of usually three magistrates, who hear the case, question witnesses, discuss the issue, and then submit their unanimous opinion for the Lord Holder to render as judgment. Often that opinion will be to ‘refer’ a case: that is, to assign a Harper to take responsibility for investigating the details of the case further, and then present a report for the panel to use to decide in a later session.

The Lord Holder can in some cases involve himself in the proceeding, and in theory, could render a judgment other than one recommended by his magistrates, but this is usually considered poor form, even in cases where this is used to break an impasse and select a majority non-unanimous opinion.

### Court Minor

Court Minor is the main regularly-scheduled court session type in which holders are generally admitted to petition directly. In larger holds, Court Minor is presided over by a single Magistrate, and tried by a panel consisting of that Magistrate and two other harper Jurists. In smaller cotholds, Court Minor might be held instead by the Lord and a larger jury drawn from all available masters of their craft, but functions essentially the same.

Court Minor expects this panel to be unanimous in the same way as Court Major, but unlike Court Major, this unanimous opinion isn’t referred to the Lord Holder, but instead rendered directly as a judgment by the presiding magistrate, by the power invested in them by the Lord Holder who appointed them.

Court Minor is rarely given power over life and death; and it’s expected that many of the issues that holders will petition it for will be outside the court’s own power. In these cases, the petition is ‘referred’, and made the responsibility for a member of the panel to then investigate and present it in Court Major on the petitioner’s behalf. Traditionally this becomes the responsibility of the most senior dissenting panel member, but it can be someone else the magistrate assigns if that default would somehow be inappropriate.

Court Minor can be thought of as something between a modern ‘Small Claims Court’ process and the processes that a modern ‘Prosecutor’s Office’ would use to decide whether or not to accept a case.

### Court Referent

When a Court Major or Court Minor refers a case, the harper assigned to it — the Referee — is given specific inquisitorial power to investigate the details of a case, which includes the ability to hold Court Referent, where they can summon witnesses and command them to answer questions.

Court Referent also serves another purpose, though: while Court Major and Court Minor are expected to protect the traditional rights guaranteed to a lord’s subjects by Tort Law, Court Referent is a lot more flexible. This court has implicit power to apply its discretion to report on a case in whatever light they feel is appropriate — and ideally, this will mean applying Equity Law to develop a recommendation, rather than reporting only bare facts for a Court Major to judge under Tort Law.

Officially, Equity Law requires that both parties consent to this type of recommendation, and a Referee is not *supposed* to use the implied threat of casting an uncooperative party in a negative light to pressure them to waive their rights under Tort Law… but that *does* often happen in practice, and it’s no secret that most lords and magistrates turn a blind eye to or even explicitly encourage this.

Aside from witnesses to a crime, a Referee also has the power to summon a Peer Jury: in this system, not a trier of fact, but rather an advisory committee meant to advise a Referee on unique local concerns, and aid in finding a community-centered solution.

When applicable, once Court Major has ruled on a referee’s report, the Referee may have the power to levee soldiers or a posse to execute the ruling against uncooperative parties. In this capacity, they might also be called by the etymological-cousin term ‘Sheriff’.

### Court Matrimonial

Court Matrimonial is something of an oddball court, usually held in the same courtroom as Court Major with all of the same ritual usually including the Lord Holder presiding; but it’s one where holders are admitted to petition — specifically, for *couples* to petition to be married (with all other types of petition excluded).

Sessions of Court Matrimonial are held on a regular basis, often monthly; they are not individual weddings, but rather a large scale civic affair where dozens of couples each petition in turn — though with *some* individual ceremony to it: The couples approach and petition one at a time; the panel pretends to hem and haw about it and give life advice; and then the Lord declares the couple married over these objections with their own bit of pronouncement and waffle (e.g. “I have faith that the two of you will overcome these concerns the same way I hope for you to each have faith in the other.”)

Given that marriages are, in this tradition, granted by the Lord Holder directly, divorces necessarily need to be granted directly as well — but there’s no equivalent special-purpose divorce court, and getting a divorce petition heard in Court Major can be difficult.

## Courts of Peers

### Rendition and Extradition

When a claimant is offended, they petition their Lord for redress; when their petition is also against another subject of their same lord, this can be handled simply by that lord; but when the petition is against a subject of a different lord, some level of indirection is required.

The tort itself is tried as usual within either Court Minor or Court Major, to to establish the truth of the claim and determine the appropriate bote. Once judged, though, the claimant (or their representative) must also petition to Court Major for Rendition: that is, for the lord to fulfill their oath to defend them from the offense, by writing or applying his seal to a pre-written Letter of Rendition that will be sent to the tortfeasor’s lord.

This form of a letter of rendition names and describes the tort, and names the specific tortfeasor — but just like the letters of rendition a weyr uses to collect tithes from holds, the demand it makes for payment of the specific monetary value of the bote is made of the *lord*, not the specific tortfeasor.

For very small demands, the petitioner’s lord may sometimes even  choose to pay out the demand from his own coffer; and then collect a combined total later on in a quarterly ‘settling of accounts’ rendition letter.

Otherwise, when a lord receives a letter of rendition from one of his peers, it’s expected that he pay it immediately from his own coffer, with full faith that his peer’s quasi-neutral magistrates have investigated the matter thoroughly and set a fair bote or tithe. It’s then *his* responsibility to collect that sum back from his own subjects.

Paying a Letter of Rendition is ultimately a *diplomatic* matter, not a judicial one — the existence of a letter indicates that real offense has been taken, even in the rare case that it’s taken for bullshit reasons, and it’s considered poor form to delay making the payment.

For very large demands, though — a manbote, or an unusually large tortbote that the receiving lord doesn’t believe his subject can pay — there’s one other option aside from full payment: Extradition.

During the beginning of the extradition process, the extraditee can petition for a number of things — e.g. for their lord to pay part of the bote (from arguments like self-defense), or to appeal and have a referee re-try the case locally in order to make a counter-offer on the basis of some detail they believe was missed in the original trial. Otherwise, if the extraditee can’t satisfy the full amount of the bote through the sale of their property, they are indentured for the remaining debt, and then their property and indenture are ‘sold’ to the plaintiff’s lord to release the extraditee’s lord from the remaining obligation.

Very occasionally, though, if a lord feels that a demand is so unjust that he can neither pay it himself nor extradite the named party, not even in the name of continued civility…

### Court Arbitrary

Court Arbitrary usually involves a panel that combines multiple magistrate circuits, but it’s not unknown for the master of harperhall or some other specifically chosen representative to preside in an especially contentious dispute. Far more important to the function of Court Arbitrary, though, is the jury of peers: other lords who the court calls on to participate in the process, who can apply pressure to rein disputing lords back in or potentially offer their own solutions to a dispute.

Without this jury, Court Arbitrary has little actual power — its arbitrator’s status lends their opinions *some* weight, but using that weight to force an issue could cost the Harpers influence in the long term, and destabilize the faith in their neutrality that the whole system depends on. The purpose of this court is to keep civility intact, even at the cost of injustice; it exists as a last line meant to prevent breakdowns in cooperation and the beginnings of wars.

If this were to fail? Well, they don’t call it “prosecuting a war” for nothing.

## Courts of a Weyr

### Chain of Command

Most minor infractions by riders and candidates are handled through the regular chain of command, using an informal disciplinary procedure that’s only as complicated as an offender’s superior officer wants to make it when they call them in to their office, give them a dressing-down, and assign them to shovel shit for a week.

### Court General

Court General operates for the most part like Court Major, but allows any subject of the weyr to petition to it rather than just members of a specific “courtier” class. This court exists for continuity with holder law, so that disputes involving holders are judged in a way that preserves their expected legal rights and privileges. Court General does *not* accept petitions for disputes that involve only riders and candidates.

Court General is presided over by a weyr’s Magistrate General (an officer commission meant for a Harper Rider). Like Court Major, it also has a panel of three harper Magistrates — traditionally, a traveling circuit panel, who are *not* riders. This panel applies the same tort law as holder courts to either refer issues or recommend opinions to the Magistrate General.

For disputes that don’t implicate the weyr itself or its riders or candidates, it’s expected that the panel’s opinion will be rendered as judgment. But Court General also exists specifically to act as a filter for claims that would distract or detract from the weyr’s mission, by taking up a rider’s time to defend or costing the weyr a tortbote it cannot afford — therefore, in such cases, it’s far more ordinary for the Magistrate General to deviate from the panel’s opinion.

The Magistrate General is expected to report major offenses or repeated problems across the chain of command for discipline when appropriate, but when bote is to be paid for a rider’s tort, it’s always paid directly by the court from the General Claims budget without involving the rider. (This sometimes, but not always, also applies to claims against candidates.) The accused is rarely involved until after the fact, and if they’re involved directly it’s usually as part of a Court Martial.

### Court Martial

A weyr’s Court Martial is one of the few places in Pern that considers offenses *crimes* rather than just torts. Court Martial is convened when there is a major or repeated issue, as a way for an offender’s commander to mitigate his own culpability for his subordinate’s infraction, and allow more experienced leaders to weigh in and find comprehensive ways of addressing an issue.

Court Martial is presided over jointly by the weyrleader and weyrwoman, and includes all of the officers along the direct chain of command to the offender; often with a number of other more specialized advisors on the panel as well.

Anything that might directly impact a weyr’s mission in a negative way is a crime against all of society, and court martial applies a modification of Equity Law that emphasizes the importance of that mission above all else. Often this is approached from a rehabilitative perspective, but unlike with holder courts there is no requirement for a rider or candidate to consent to Equity Law, and its punishments can be both more lenient *and* more harsh than what Tort Law would dictate.

#### Restitution

Holder law might assign a fixed tortbote to be paid by an offender, but in a weyr this means finding the resources to fix what is broken from *whatever* source is needed, and in whatever amount is needed to *actually* fix it instead of just being a “fair price”. In cases where someone was killed, this can also mean identifying candidates for promotion into the vacancy.

#### Rehabilitation

Holder law might allow a Referee to recommend therapy, but in a weyr this usually means far more than just that: This means examining *all* of the factors that could have contributed to a situation. That is: blaming the process, not the individual. Correct deficiencies in training, unsafe standard procedures, communications barriers, equipment malfunctions, or even the specifics of a leadership culture that prevented earlier informal reprimands from being effective.

#### Reminder

Holder law might try to deter people with fines, but in a weyr it’s understood that deterrence is not a particularly productive way to address problems, and quickly snowballs into a dysfunctional leadership culture that encourages hiding problems instead of reporting and correcting them. When a punishment is assigned, making it public can be useful; but assigning a punishment for the sake of publicity is much less so.

#### Removal

Holder law might eventually remove someone through indenture, but in a weyr this usually means ensuring that someone who isn’t competent to lead or perform a task is demoted to a position that does not require that task of them. Temporary measures, like confining someone to their quarters or a brig, might be applied to allow temporary disputes to cool off; a rider might be transferred or exiled to another weyr to break a persistent feud, or a candidate may be discharged; but weyrs rarely have the resources to imprison someone long-term.

#### Retribution

Holder law might say an offense is worth some amount of money, but in a weyr this reflects a harsher reality: to not punish someone visibly and proportionally when others feel hurt or cheated prevents them from being fully accepted back by their community, and invites future breakdowns in communication and teamwork. This can often mean a highly-visible punishment detail, but often a court martial will use other punishments like flagellation (especially participatory variations like ‘running the gauntlet’), or a stocks or pillory.

#### Retaliation

Holder law may satisfy primal instincts that demand blood, but in a weyr this reason is explicitly considered only to avoid it. The frustration and anger an incident has provoked may only be human, but the mission demands that a weyr collectively be more than that — and sometimes, that means swallowing our pride and accepting injustice as a reality of war.
