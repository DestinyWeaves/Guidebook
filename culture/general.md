# Pernese Culture & Customs

## Religion
Pern has absolutely NO Religion. There is no God, deities, or anything of the sort, nor organized worship.
The closest thing that exists is a reverence for dragons and their riders far closer to the idea of celebrity (say Football Players, Singers, etc.)

“Thank Farnath” or "By the First Egg” - references to the Last Gold to the hatch of the very first Clutch of Dragons who impressed to Sorka Hanrahan

## Timekeeping

Days of the week are ordinal: Firstday, Seconday, Thirday, through to the Seventhday.
This results in a week being called a Sevenday.

A ‘cone’ (of incense burn time) is half an hour, a candle mark is an hour.

A Year is a called a Turn or turn, though the word year is used in phrasing: The Turning of the Year, but Turn’s End is the actual ‘festival’.

## Three Worlds
### Holds
Medieval towns built into the base and heart of mountainous bedrock, a majority of a hold is ‘underground’ and covered by the mountain which has rooms and spaces carved into it by laser (colonists) or chisel work in later construction.

Holdfolk are comprised of people who are not bonded to dragons and they usually have a Craft that they have gained proficiency in.

Agriculture and Animal Husbandry and assorted Crafts tend to be their main source of exports and income.

### Halls
The Centers of Learning, you may think of it as a Medieval Apprenticeship, with a guild called a “Crafthall” that is the main source of learning.

All Crafthalls have a Mastercrafter. The Master of their Hall is usually called Craftmatster, and each craft has a central hall overseen by said Craftmaster.

Holdcraft-usually means one lacks the ‘formal’ training.

Apprentices join around age 10. US/UK: High School Proficiency

Journeyman is the next step by “Walking the Tables” around 20-25 US: Bachelors/ UK: Undergraduate Studies

Mastery: The title of "Master &lt;name&gt; of &lt;craft&gt;", ex. Master Forsen of SmithCraft. US/UK: Masters/Ph.D


### Weyrs
Commonly, a Weyr is a Military City or Base - and the only place dragonriders live. They are like Holds are literally built into the rock of a mountain with with rooms and storage, along with larger rooms, much like a bee hive.

Dragons are a part of the culture and are only Impressible at a <b>Weyr</b>. They change a person’s life forever as they graft themselves onto a person’s psyche until their or their bonded’s death. These dragonriders are now tied to the Weyr that they Impressed at as dragon and rider pair. That said, they  can transfer out after their basic training ( Weyrlinghood) if they so wish.

Dragonriders do have places for growing food, and medicine, have and an entire small town’s worth of support staff.
The Holds under a Weyr’s protection pay tithe to that Weyr - think of it as paying your city taxes to the county in which you live.

## Pernese Culture & Customs
Pern Culture tends to be a bit ‘static’, there are changes and the like but things move a bit more like a traditional “medieval” world, than a fantasy world.

In polite conversation, or a formal setting (i.e. writing a letter) you would say/write: Rank, name then craft for anyone Journeyman and below. I.e: Apprentice Melisan of  Weaver Hall. For referring to a Master, you’d put Master Craft Name. IE: Master Harper Honila. If you’re writing to the CraftMaster, then you’d put: Craft Master Name of Crafthall. IE: CraftMaster Obiton of Harperhall

## Hair Culture
Hair care culture on Pern is diverse. Scented animal fat is a common form of moisturizing, once it has been rendered into tallow. Most common are oils or other ‘treated’ products that might be able to be used. Most women wrap their hair at night.

Braids are common on Pern, especially in Weyrs, hair being kept close to the head is useful during thread fall.

Holdfolk is more acceptable for men and women to have their hair long

Hair Pins- think Chinese and Japanese-styled. Most pins are made of Bamboo, called “WoodGrass”- as a substitute for wood, which is extremely rare on Pern. Only a few tree species exist, but of those few, only Ironwood & Skybroom are suitable for use as furniture but are notoriously difficult to work with.

Hair is used as an advertisement for availability- updos, often signaling someone is off the market.

Braids can be used to signal other things, this varies from hold to hold, some places use ‘bead code’ to further communicate messages

How a bead is set: its height, the position in a string of beads, and sometimes even the design might have particular meaning [Submit Your Ideas, Dear Players].
