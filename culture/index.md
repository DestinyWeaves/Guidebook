<h3>Pernese 101</h3>
<h4>Pern has NO Religion</h4>
<ul>There is no God, deities, or anything of the sort, nor organized worship.
<li>The closest thing that exists is a mild reverence for Dragons, and their riders are far closer to the idea of celebrity (say Football Players, Taylor Swift etc..)</li>
<li><b>“Thank Farnath”</b> or <b>"By the First Egg”</b> references to the Last Gold to the hatch of the very first Clutch of Dragons who impressed to Sorka Hanrahan</li></ul>
<h4> Pern Basics</h4>
<ul><li> Days of the week are ordinal: Firstday, Second day,Third day, all the way to the Sevenday.</li>
<li> This results in a Week being called a Sevenday</li>
<li> Months do not have names but are simply: Winter 3 - January, Spring 1 February, Spring 2 - March, Spring 3 - April, Summer 1 - May, Summer 2 - June, Summer 3 - July, Fall 1 - August, Fall 2 - September, Fall 3 - October, Winter 1 - November, Winter 2 - December </li>
<li>A Year is called a Turn, though the word year is used in phrasing: The Turning of the Year, but TurnsEnd is the actual ‘festival’ to celebrate the end of the Year/Turn.</li>
<li>A  candle mark is an hour</li>
<li> A pass is 50 Turns- A Pass of the “Red Star” which rains Thread.</li>
<li>Thread: A Space fungus that looks like silver rain. It <b>EATS Organic Matter </b>(anything that is not Rock, Steel or dirt is fair game).</li>
<li>Only two things destroy it: Fire, Water, HNO3 (Agenothree).</li>
<li> An Interval is 200 Turns where no Thread falls</li>
<li> A long interval is 400 Turns</li></ul>

<ul><b><h3>Pern has <b>three</b> main “cultures”</b></ul></h3>
<h4>Holds</h4><ul>
<li> Medieval towns built into the base and heart of mountainous bedrock, a majority of a Hold is ‘underground’ covered by a mountain</li>
<li> Holdfolk are comprised of people who are not bonded to dragons, they usually have a Craft.</li>
<li> Agriculture/animal husbandry & Crafts tend to be their main source of export income.</li>
<li> The local Lord is a Lord Holder</li>
<li> His second command is a Headwoman [for women] and Stewart [for men] IF the Lord Holder doesn’t have a Lady Holder. If he does have a wife, the Lady Holder becomes Second in command, and the Headwoman/Stewart then comes under her.</li>
<li>Normally it is the Male line that inherits a Hold, however, if no male heirs exist, then the wife or sister of the now-deceased Lord Holder can then take charge of the Hold. However, once they re-marry, they lose that title. </li>
<li>Divorce is a very uncommon thing to happen. Divorce can only happen if a history of abuse is shown and proven. A breakdown due to lack of love isn’t considered a valid reason for divorce. This is why marriage between holders takes a very long time before the ceremony comes to light.</li> 
</ul>
<h4>Halls</h4>
<ul><li>The Centers of Learning, think of it a Medieval Apprenticeship, with a guild, called a “Crafthall”</li>
<li>All Crafthalls have a Master Crafter. The MASTER of their Hall, each craft has a central hall. Holdcraft usually means one lacks the ‘formal’ training.</li>
<li> Apprentices join around age 12.US/UK: High School Profficency</li>
<li> Journeyman is the next step by “Walking the Tables” around 20-25- US: Bachelors/ UK: Undergrad</li>
<li> Mastery: can earn as in your 30s & the title of “Master <name>” of <Craft>, ex. Master Forsen of SmithCraft. US/UK: Masters/Ph.D</li>
<li><em>CraftMaster</em> Master of Masters, the leader of a Crafthall “CraftMaster Sohana of Woodcraft Hall</li></ul>
<br>
<h4>Weyrs</h4> 
<ul><li> A Military City/Base- the only place dragonriders live. They, like Holds, are built into mountains, literally into the rock of a mountain like a bee hive.</li>
<li>Dragons are a part of the culture and are only impressible at a Weyr. They change a person’s life forever. They are now tied to the Weyr that joined them as dragon & rider(though they can transfer)</li>
<li>They do have places for growing food, and medical and an entire small town’s worth of support staff.</li>
<li> The Holds under a Weyr’s protection Tithe to that Weyr- think of it as your county paying taxes to the state in which you live.</li>
<li> Weyrleader is the military arm of leadership & Weyrwoman is domestic arm. In the canon of Destiny weaves- the two positions have been de-coupled from the Mating Flight of the most senior queen (i.e. the oldest more mature gold + her sexual partner male for her latest flight & the father of clutch)- and have switched to a 4 year vote- system.</li></ul>
