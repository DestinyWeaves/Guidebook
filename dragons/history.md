# 6th Pass Noteable Clutches

In the 6th Pass, **Gold Kolith** was caught by **Bronze Jordith** and laid a good, sturdy clutch of 7\.   
The clutch contained the following viable dragons:

Gold Radith, Bronze Bunith, Ixia Sirth \[F\], Ixia Oceth \[F\], Green Metholith, Quartz Croceth \[M\], Ixia Metith \[M\]

 \[This was the first instance of Ixia and Quartz dragons to make an appearance in Pernese clutches.\]

Ixia Sirth \[F\] mated with Brown Konith and laid a clutch of two eggs that were put with Gold Kolith’s clutch. From those two eggs, Quartz Toliruth \[F\] and Blue Makuth were hatched. 

Quartz (Silver) Toliruth was flown by Brown Halriath and laid five eggs, but cared for 7 eggs.   
\[first instance of Ruby and Aster\]

Blue Dondarith, Ruby Sagriath \[F\], Quartz Tikyolath \[M\], Green Zunrelith, Aster Farleth,   
Ixia Alorith \[F\]  \- upon speaking with the Quartz, it turned out to be Green Vecoth’s dragonet.   
Gold Vaikairath \- upon speaking with the Quartz, it turned out to be Green Caizuth and Bronze Sukoth’s egg. This is the first NOTED instance of a Green laying a Gold Egg. 

As noted by Harpers,  an extra marking also came out during this Pass, _Pearled_. However, other than making the dragon look like it has a pearlescent coating it made no difference to its abilities or flights. 

It’s also noted that all pale Quartz that look White or are close to white have this marking. It was in this Pass that was also documented that all other colors could get the Pearl marking, except for the very dark Quartz. Perlith was the first Gold to have Pearling. 

Gold Perlith mated to Ruby Sodoth and produced a very impressive clutch of 12\.  
   
Bronze Jemsith, Gold Ifoth, Brown Echalith, Ruby Eryth \[M\], Green Auleth, Brown Uqeth, Aster Iyuath\[F\], Quartz Akydeth \[F\], Aster Ranath \[F\], Ixia Uniteth \[M\], Green Shargnarath, Blue Warseth 

_All members of the clutch had the Pearl gene._

Markings themselves are noted to be more distinctive in Browns, Greens, and Blues. Markings present on Bronzes and Golds are more subtle. Pearling is a **marking overlay**. For example; a dragon with a filagree marking can also have pearling.
