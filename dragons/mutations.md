# Mutations

## Attitudes

### Benden

**Benden** due to its proximity in the mountain ranges, has a number of the **Bioluminescence genetic mutation** preferring to use that particular mutation to aid in flight maneuvers in the foggy, cloudy mountain ranges. **Pearled Males** at **Benden** are NOT allowed into Flights and are sent away during Gold flights to ensure that the Gold Bloodlines keep their biolume breeding status.

### Telgar

**Telgar** bred for the **Velvet** hide mutation in their dragons to help keep their dragons dry during the heavy rain pours. This trait has been proven to make these dragons less prone to cracking hides as they have a thick pelt that is hydrophobic.\[Estimated to be around 1 million hairs per square inch\]. 

**Telgar** refuses to allow **Scaled Dragons** into mating flights. 

### High Reaches
**High Reaches,** in contrast, went absolutely *wild* over the Pearled gene and thus attempted to have *only Pearled Males* catch their Golds. As a result, High Reaches Weyr has the most pearled dragons.

### Ista
**Ista** bred for **non-mutated dragons**, preferring to keep to the original dragon colours well known in the records.   
–	**Ista** refuses to allow mutations due to its stance on non-mutated dragons being superior and ‘preserving’ the original body type as *intended*.

### Igen
**Igen** adores the **Scaled dragon gene** that came out of their first clutch of genetically altered dragons and thus bred many of the following clutches to favour the heat-resistant gene that resulted in the Scaled mutation. This particular mutation has become the Weyr’s pride and joy. Dragons who have the scaled mutation shed their scales and groom each other regularly to remove scales, though their bonded may assist. These dragons also don’t require oiling, they’re grooming is more based around ensuring that they’re clean as fungal infections of the scales is more likely. 

### Fort
**Fort** welcomes **all dragon mutations**, but are far more strict with their breeding to ensure viable, healthy clutches. 

## Mutations

Scaled
: Medium scales across the dragon’s hide, major head plating. (see image)

Pearled
: Iridescence that can be seen across the spectrum of colours and has no bearing on their rank, abilities or status.

Velvet
: Soft, dense, extremely short coat, much like the fabric the mutation gets its name from.

Biolume
: Glowing, bioluminescent colours from purples and pinks to golds, spanning the colour spectrum of the dragons themselves. It is either Bright or Not Bright

**Scaled** & **Velvet** are mutually exclusive mutations. **Pearled** & **Biolume** are mutually exclusive mutations.

**Feathers, extra limbs are lethal mutations.**

### Clutch Fever

Clutch Fever is more common in Greens and Ixias and stems from overbreeding. Less commonly, but still present, this phenomena is also seen in Ruby and Quartz, but has an extremely rare chance of cropping up in Golds. After a dragon clutch has been laid, a dragonrider is cautioned for *a full turn* with no clutch to avoid it. After clutching, the clutching dragon is recommended to have a full meal of bone, horn, and hide with a small amount of meat to replace the lost nutrients from producing eggshells to avoid clutch fever.

#### Long-Term Effects
Dull cracking hide/pelt, **dud eggs** will form the majority of eggs laid, and have fragile membranes which will split if under *any* pressure. The dam’s claws have been known to split when walking and their bones are weakened with an inability to regulate body temperature. Their teeth will become brittle and fall out and they will undergo massive weight loss. In the last stage of the disease, there is an extremely high hemorrhagic fever, and finally, death. 

To avoid this particular nasty illness, *all green riders* are taught that after flights that if their dragon has already clutched within the last turn, they must go *between* after a Flight to abort the clutch. 

It takes **5 generations of outbreeding** to remove a mutation from the genetic code.
