# Watch Whers

For a while after their creation, Whers were considered a failed dragon experiment. It wasn't until Wind blossoms work was checked that it was found that she attempted to improve upon the design put in place by Kitty Ping, and that the body plan also had some odd linking to their genes.

With her change to the shoulder, by trying to make both joints more similar to human shoulders, she'd accidentally caused the wing joint to revert back to its primitive design, looking more like the actually front shoulder joint in a dragon, whereas their front leg had the more 'refined' ball and socket joint system that allowed for both more muscle anchor points and more range of movement. The effect was that wher wings shrunk down and only be usable for gliding rather flying.

But with the ball socket joint in the front limb, allowed for more movement range and much heavier muscle. IT was also noted that the changes that Wind Blossom made for stronger bones also increased the weight of the whers so much that sustained flight would be impossible and that if a wher broke a bone it would take longer heal than dragons, although it wasn't as long as people.

As the first whers were considered incomplete, Wind Blossom tried again, believing that she could revert it back to Kitty Ping's original format, but with a lighting storm having wiped some of the data banks, she was instead stuck with her current format. So she went on trying to modify the format she had, where she had ended up creating the whers are we now know them. The shoulder joints remained as the same as her first attempt, but she modified the feet, adding ridges along the toes, making them both more mobile and having the ridges made it so the whers would walk up walls and 'stick' to them like the Earth-like Geckos. With another modification to the eyes, she attempted to reduce their sun shyness, although she wasn't fully successful, she was able to make that her 2nd wher design was less sun adverse. This was in part to making the 3rd eyelid a little thicker to act as shade against the light.

With more mobile toes, the claws were able to be changed to being retractable and making them both harder but less prone to snapping, especially with the original whers being used in the mines to great success. It was the suggestion from the miners that Wind Blossom make them less sun shy and giving them sticky toes to walk up walls to ensure that the whers wouldn't get harmed whilst the miners were moving carts about.
