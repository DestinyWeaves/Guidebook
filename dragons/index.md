# Dragons

Pern Dragons are _different_.

Dragons are carnivorous[^carnivorous], oviparous[^oviparous], endothermic[^endothermic] creatures.
Like all of Pern's native large fauna, they are Hexapod.[^hexapod]. Their blood, referred to as ichor, is copper-based and green in colour. 

They had multifaceted[^multifaceted] eyes that changed colour depending on the dragon's mood. Should only some of these facets be damaged, a dragon would still have limited vision in the remaining ones. The head and body shape of a Dragon is closer to that of a horse.

[^carnivorous]: Meat eating.
[^oviparous]: Lays eggs for reproductive purposes.
[^endothermic]: Warm blooded.
[^hexapod]: Four feet, two wings; six limbs total.
[^multifaceted]: Eyes that are similar to flies and cut gems, with multiple lenses/facets.

They had small head-knobs, similar to those of giraffes, and no visible ears. 
Their talons were extremely heat and cold-resistant. Pern dragons traditionally had a smooth hide rather than scales; the texture of their skin was described as being reminiscent of suede with a spicy, sweet scent when clean.

On Destiny Weave we have mutations including: Scaled, Pearled , Bioluminesce & Velvet.

The largest a dragon will get is 15ft from shoulder to the floor. Dragon is measured from standing from the crest of their shoulder to the floor. wing span is measured from wingtip to wingtip at full spread. Dragon length is measured from nose to tail tip with the dragon laying down and stretching out.

Its noted in canon that due to the triple helix structure of dragons, that dragons didn't have a blood type per say, which allowed for transfusions between different dragons, although its preferred that any transfusion from a dragon should be given one of the same colour.

In Destiny Weaves, a dragon's defecation isn't in the tail fork but at the base of the tail, with the females having a genital slit on the front of their pelvis. Males also have a slit but have a prehensile penis that allows for copulation during flights, both genders of dragons have their reproductive systems tucked within their bodies to protect them for damage, especially during threadfall.

So other avenues of mating were attempted but it was found that getting a dragon to mount one another like dogs, was impossible due to the genitals being in the wrong place and having dragons attempt to copulate like people was also deemed dangerous for dragons due to their wings and the spine having elongated processes that functioned as muscle anchor points in the body, as well as a sternum ridge that allows for muscle anchor points on the chest.

Dragon shoulders are built a little different, with their front shoulder joint being more those of dinosaur shoulder, with thick rectangle scapula that sits on the top of the ribcage with more triangular shoulder for the wings sitting over the top. They've got a pronounced clavicle that allows for the ball and socket joint of the wing more range of movement that allows for dragons to fly.

Dragon bones are also interesting in that aren't as solid as one would think, but instead have a more honey comb structure to reduces weight. This also means that it takes dragons far less time to heal from broken bones than a person. On Destiny Weave we have mutations including: Scaled, Pearled , Bioluminescence & Velvet.

## Impression

Dragons Impress to people 18 years or older. [dragons haven’t impressed to anyone younger than 18 since the 2nd pass when several riders have mass breakdowns during threadfall] 

20 years before the 8th Pass, the Weyrs unanimously agreed that they would search only people of sufficient maturity both mentally and physically as Pass would see Threadfall. Exposing an immature mind to the rigors and horrors of Threadfall injury was determined unsound morality.

{: .important-title }
> Important: No Sexuality Based Impression
> 
> Dragons do not care about a human’s sexuality or preference, only golds and bronzes have any care about biological gender. 

Weyrbred folk had a tendency to impress over holdbred. 


## Candidate Training

Candidacy is a Harper-lead outside of the Weyr( a six week crash-course), separated from the Candidacy Weyr Course( which is 12 week course)

Dragon Etiquette lesson - Don’t Block when you go into a Weyr. ”Are you ok, friend?”

Dragons are constantly checking on people. It's something that seems to be built into them, the way birds know how to build a nest.

If blocked from the mental check in, dragons have been known to go hunt down the person and pin them down to ensure they’re okay. 

Dragons can and will scoop people up and take them to the mindhealer office if they’re mind is in a bad place. 

At the end of completion of Candidacy the first time they are given the option of getting a firelizard egg. [Weyr Candidate training ONLY]

Candidates are ‘employed’ by the Weyr and thus candidate training is completed.

 Bonus Marks for the Candidate Lesson Thread an extra 50 points.

## Flights
In Flights, Dragon vs Dragon PVP is VERY rare( PC vs PC dragons). Females may admonish males, but only golds really get into ‘flight aggression’ with other golds. However it is noted that this aggression only comes out during a flight, once they’ve risen, Golds do not care who rises after they’re done. Some bronzes/Rubies/Quartz/browns may have a brief scraps when jockeying for the ‘best’ place in the pack but this rarely results in injury, let alone serious injuries. Notably it's the young inexperienced dragons that tend to scrap during flights. Older and experienced dragons know better than to waste energy scrapping in a flight. 

## Clutching
Dragon Eggs are soft and leathery when laid and around 2 - 3ft when laid, hardening to their full firmness after two weeks on the sands.

After a clutch is laid the hatching sands are VERY well lit to ensure the safety of the clutch and anyone on the sands. 

## Touching
Touching dragon eggs evokes a feeling, not a discussion.

Dragons babies need human minds to be open at touching, thus the candidates are instructed to keep them open: warm, and welcoming. All candidates are checked by an adult dragon before being allowed onto the sands to ensure a healthy mindset. 

## Hatchings
- Dialogueless Hatchings are the Norm, VERY RARELY a baby dragon (dragonet) talks to anyone during hatching, this only happens if someone is trying to force an impression, and then its a broadcast not private OR if the dragonet has hurt someone by accident.
- When checking, candidates would feel a weight in their mind as the dragonet checks them to see if they’re compatible  
- Babies are highly focused on Impressing and finding theirs 
- Babies are going to be ungainly and unsteady
  - getting hurt is a real possibility.
  - Baby can hurt humans before impresses and sometimes do
  - All babies will snap at each other demanding their own ‘space’ is someone else is too close.
- Headaches are very common in hatchings and after impressions.
- “Candi-doots STOP!””Choose LIFE!”


## Firestone 
Delays flight cycle by 1 week for each day of chewing. [1 day of threadfall = 1 week late cycle]


## Dragon/Rider Care

Watch out for:

### Dragon Illnesses

Pot Belly
: Gorgeing on meat to excess.

Hide Rot
: Leaving a dragon with wet hide without drying.
