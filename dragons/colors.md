# Dragon Colors

The Dragons of the 8th Pass Pern of Destiny Weaves are not the mammoth ‘Jet plane sized’ dragons of Anne McCaffrey’s book of the Ninth Pass.

The dragons of the Destiny Weaves are far closer to their “programmed” sizes as defined by the Geneticist Kitti Ping, so around 10 - 15 ft tall at the shoulder and around 40 - 45 ft in length at the longest.
 
15ft at the shoulder is considered massive. The way people marveled at Ramoth’s size is how someone would view 15ft tall dragon of Destiny Weaves.

{: .note }
> Dragons at Destiny Weaves measured from the peak of the shoulder to the ground with the dragon being stood on all fours. Dragon length is measured from nose-tip to tail-tip.

{: .important }
> Dragons do not care about their bonded’s sexuality or assigned sex at birth. If you identify as female, a gold is just likely to chose you and anyone else, the same goes for bronze. 

{: .important }
> No dragon has the ability to "command" another dragon.

{: .note }
> All dragons have the "search sense" ability -- even if some may choose to ignore it.


## Gold
Golds tend to stick to being mothers, ferociously protective and even territorial with being on the sands and their mates during rising. Like with people, there are shades of grey in personalities, a gold may hatch that has absolutely no interest in being a mother, and in other cases, it may be all the gold wants to do. With this in mind, Golds are well known for going into the hatching sands and pushing other dragons off the sands to take over the clutch as they aren’t capable of producing flame; some golds feel it's their duty to take care of the next generation.

Like people they like to stick with their own colors, having been around and treated with deference and awe, some of the golds never forgot this but that power position from their hide has gone for a long time.  

Physically, they’re known for being one of the biggest dragons on Pern, [don’t tell Cath that she’s smaller than Pireth, she’ll throw a fit] tends to garner a lot of attention, especially with the metallic shine to their hides. The color ranges from a metallic orangey-yellow, a rich butter yellow, a pale straw yellow, all the way across to a green mustard hue. The diversity of color in Golds is huge and thus you will never have two golds the same.

## Ruby
Ruby seem to have settled themselves quite firmly between Bronze and Gold. And they are quite happy there, thank you very much. When referred to a sub-queens, you’re more likely to get snorted on and get a tail slap for the remark. Although some share very similar traits with Golds, they also can have traits of a bronze. [gender has no bearing here] A ruby is a ruby, and is a ruby. They’ve no interested in being grouped in with any other color. 

Some feel like their purpose is duty bound to flame thread, others have lioness mother instincts, but ultimately they’ll give way to a gold because they know they can flame thread. 

Physically they reach a size just under gold and bronze, but it's not uncommon for a ruby to dip into those sizes.  The clutches they lay are almost the same size as a Gold. It’s also known that Ruby males are perfectly capable of siring gold in their clutches.  

The color of ruby definitely sits very firmly in the red hue. Going from a pale imperial red right along the red range to a dark wine red.

## Bronze
Bronzes, ahhh what can we see about these nobles dragons? They’re not as egotistical as you think. In fact, most tend to be pretty humble, although they’d be the first to dive head first to threadfall to prove their worth. Like all other colors, Bronze vary widely in personality and a generally consistent trait is that if their bonded is being cruel/mean/egostical, the bronze will dump them in the Weyrlake to ‘cool off’. They’re also well known in choosing to ignore their riders for trying to allow their egos to take over. A large number of bronzes are also well known for likin’ their ladies, its a rare thing indeed to see a bronze sticking to only ONE dragon. 

Its also well known that bronzes sire golds, often times more successfully than any other color. In thread, they tend to form the foundation of a wing, being strong steadfast points of reference during fights, with large flame sacs they’re able to both chew more firestone and sustain their flame for longer. 

Physically they range from antique bronze to sandy bronze, a golden bronze and darkening to American Bronze.

## Quartz
Quartz dragon’s appeared during the Sixth Pass from Gold Korlith and Bronze Jordith. Along with their Ixia siblings.

Male quartz regardless of hue are able to sire Golds but it is the darker hue of Quartz that boast the better numbers. They seem to have settled themselves in between blue and brown. With the darker quartz being bigger, they tend to have the stamina to last an entire 6 hour fall, whereas the pale quartz are nimble and agile, zipping between the bulk of their bigger brethren and essentially closing the gaps. 

The females tend to be less interested in mothering a clutch than Golds or Rubies, but will happily tend eggs if the need should arise, but they’re usually more than happy to let a Gold take their clutch. 

Physically its noted that Quartz have one of the widest varieties of color. Going from a lead white to cloud grey and silver, darkening to dark charcoal grey to jet black.

# Brown
The workhorse dragon the Weyr. Not as "powerful" physically as a Bronze or a Gold, in traditional thinking. But they form a necessary backbone, well positioned to both run errands, and fly a full  six hour-fall as needed, reliably. 

Browns are an integral part of Weyr’s community. With the ability to hold flame for as long as Bronzes, since puts browns as a much needed fireforce of a wing, and with being more common than bronzes, its makes them an easily accessible part of the workforce. Browns are also known for their stamina and physical strength, given that a lot of bronzes are oft tied down with wing drills, this opens the browns up for being to avail themselves to things outside of threadfall more than bronzes, but not as much as blues, greens and Ixias. 

Color ranges from a pale latte, a soft tan, murky khaki and to a chocolate brown.

# Aster
A female dragon with bright hues,  usually pink and purple, a bright and colorful dragon. They are most often associated with  mind healers as the cheerful colors seem to brighten up most people's day. While not quite enough to fly full fall, they are typically called upon when moving people, and more often goods at least when thread not falling.  They have the stamina to fly long distances, and thus make great long distance messagers.
Otherwise, they are often used as messengers as their bright colors make them easier to spot. 

Aster’s are ‘essentially female browns’. 
With the ability to hold flame for as long as Bronzes, since puts aster in the same league as browns as part of the much-needed fireforce of a wing, and with being more common than bronzes, its makes them an easily accessible part of the workforce. Asters are also known for their stamina and physical strength, given that a lot of bronzes are oft tied down with wing drills, this opens the Asters up for being to avail themselves to things outside of threadfall more than bronzes, but not as much as blues, greens and Ixias. With Asters being on the larger end of the scale and the stamina to boot, this makes browns great for people and cargo transport. 

 They will happily babysit eggs, for a short amount of time, but are not usually considered extremely maternal, and thus may keep an eye on a clutch if another clutch minder needs a short break, but are generally not into it for the long haul.

Color ranges from a candy floss pink to rosewood pink then going to purple hues that go from lilac to raisin purple. Commonly, flashes of both pink and purple to dapple the hides of Asters.

# Blue
The smallest male color, outside of Ixias.
They are traditionally ‘paired’ with greens.
They tend to be leaned onto to fetch and carry. They can’t fly a full fall.
 They are one of the most visible dragons to be seen by Holders. They’re known for speed rather than agility. As messengers, they are prioritized over greens because of their speed.

Blues are well known for their speed, in threadfall, blues are generally the first ones to make impact in their wing formation. With Blues being so fast, they often utilize the guerilla warfare tactics on thread, hitting it fast then disappearing out of the way whilst the bigger dragons come in.

With speed being synonymous with blues, they make excellent messengers due to their ability to get to places in next to no time, as long as it is close by. Due to being smaller in size, blues lack the stamina of browns, asters and the bigger colors during threadfall. Blues, greens and Ixias will change out during a fight to give them a chance to rest between bouts of flaming and fighting. As blues have higher population density in the Weyrs, it's not uncommon to find older blues being stationed at Holds and Crafthalls. 

 
Blues are fast as if the wind itself were made incarnate. They are lighting fast and it shows. If you need someone to send a message because the situation has turned foul, you send a blue and their rider.  Blues while not able to deal with thread fall with as much stamina, their speed makes them needed part of a wing. Wheeling and turning to allow for the more agile greens to finish off the thread.


Color ranges from a powder blue to a dark navy.

# Ixia
Come in Male & female.
Born of the Sixth’s pass surge of ‘new’ colors, these dragons straddle a noticeable line, almost blue & green enough to fall into either category. The Ixias fill an important space between Blues and Greens. They stretch into Blue and Green ranges, a combination of Speed and Agility- they get the best of both worlds although they aren't as good. They’re faster than greens, but not as fast as blue. They’re more agile than blue, but not the same level as a green. They are ultimately used to fill in spaces in Wings, where you may need a blue or a green as they can cover both roles. 

Ixias are often mistaken for blues or greens on first visual inspection, and sometimes ‘masquerade’ as such; and with their numbers sitting between blues and greens, it's a common sight for Hold, Craft and Weyr to see them. As with Greens and Blues, they’re often stationed to Hold and Crafthall in case on emergencies and as a way for people to get around; outside of threadfall of course.

Color ranges from light turquoise to a dark victorian Ixia.

# Green
Greens are the most numerous dragons in a Weyr, quick [not as quick as blues admittedly] and exceptionally agile, they make the perfect stop gap in a wing formation. With their ability to twist themselves into impossible positions during flight their fighting niche is ‘weave the gap’ between the bigger dragons to stop thread coming through their formation. Greens can and often do serve messengers for Holds and Weyr, although they generally stick to difficult terrain entries with their sense to tuck wing and twist, they’re able to move themselves through what looks to be impossibly tight gaps that would have others hesitating or even refusing to attempt it. 

As greens are very mobile and able to twist themselves into weird and wonderful positions, it's noted that many greenriders have to keep an eye on their dragons to ensure they don’t end up getting stuck [this has yet to happen though], since greens will contort themselves claiming it's comfortable. Greens are perhaps the flashiest flyers in the Weyr, with their movements being mesmerizing to watch. If a hold has a celebration, greens will be the ones doing the overheard ‘displays’ with feats of impossible and amazing feats in the air. 

Color ranges from a pale tea green to a very dark sacramento green
