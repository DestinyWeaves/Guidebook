## Wings

### High altitude Wings

50 Dragons \- per Wing during Fall, with another 50 in Reserve \= 100 Dragons/Riders total 

**Prime Wing** \- Most experienced Dragons, bronzes, browns, quartz, rubies, big dragons with a lot of Stamina that can handle the high winds of Jet Streams and with the best flame control to handle clumps and tangles. Smaller dragons pop in and out from between to ‘thread the gaps’. Dragons tend to stick to taking out clumps and tangles as they are known to be the most dangerous of Threadfall.   
L’an is Wingleader/Weyrleader 

**Rise Wing** \- Same as Prime wing, but usually fly a little lower   
Y’len is currently Wingleader

### Mid altitude Wings

**Horizon Wing** \- Newly graduated dragons, reasonable flame control, still learning. Older dragons that are lacking the stamina of their prime years.

**Dawn Wing** \- Same as Horizon Wing  
G’dan is wingleader

### Low altitude Wings

**Sunrise Wing** \- Older Weyrlings going to experience threadfall.  

**Shine Wing** \- Golds and clutching dragons \[those that are NOT chewing firestone at the moment\], medical wing \[dragonhealers\]    
Vivan is Wingleader, 

### Ground Level Wing

**Restock Wing** \- Weyrling dragons that are just learning to flame, generally their duty is restock Mid to Low altitude Wings with firestone. Will go around after Threadfall to help deal with any burrows with Holders.

**Burrow Wing** \-  Whirling wing, can fly, maybe not flaming yet, only come into action AFTER a thread has fallen to clear out burrows. 

Reserve Wing \- dragons not permanently assigned to a wing but they drill as though they’re going into all-level wings.
