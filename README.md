This is the guidebook for Destiny Weaves, a semi-literate play-by-post text roleplay game set in the Pern universe and operated through JCINK and Discord.

This guidebook is meant to introduce players to the concept of text roleplay, to set expectations about how players should participate, and provide details about the world of Pern specific to Destiny Weaves, especially regarding the time period it's set in (8th pass) and the areas where it deviates from Ann McCaffrey's original world.

This guidebook is hosted through Github Pages to facilitate collaboration.
Players are encouraged to discuss and propose changes to this guidebook, or to fork this repository and modify it for use in their own projects.
