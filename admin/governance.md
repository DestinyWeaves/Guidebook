# Mission Statement

Destiny Weaves is a jcink forum and discord server community for members to participate in writing a Pern semi-literate role playing game in a constructive and pro-creative environment.

# Objectives

Destiny Weaves is governed under a set of objectives to ensure the overall goal of having a friendly, welcoming community.

1. Members can expect the community’s moderators to act with discretion in the best interests of the community.  
2. Members can expect the community to be governed by the norms of respect, courtesy, and common sense.  
3. Members can expect all but designated areas of the community to be broadly "safe for work", and to have sensitive topics properly marked and handled with maturity and grace.  
4. Members can expect their time and energy to be respected and for their contributions not to be disrupted by irrelevant or inappropriate material.  
5. Members can expect to interact with peers invested in the norms, style, and future of the community.

# Guidelines

1. To promote original storytelling and fair attribution, members are expected to post only original writing they themself composed, or that’s appropriately cited to its author; with the exception that writers may implicitly use material considered “canon” to the Pern setting without originality restrictions.  
   1. To keep the community centered on creative skill and original art, the output of programs designed to outsource effort is not considered original writing. Examples of effort-outsourcing programs include chatbots, large language models, or procedural generators; but it is permissible to take inspiration from these programs when composing posts, or to use their outputs as only a small part (such as a generated name).  
   2. To allow members creative expression and avoid an excessive burden for a community focused around written rather than visual art, members may still use any means they choose to produce or source visual artwork for things like character profile images and illustrations.  
2. To ensure that participation in this community does not become a burden, members are expected to limit repeated reminder pings to at most once per week. Members have lives and obligations with family, friends, work, and other things outside of this community that they must be allowed to prioritize over participation in a roleplay.  
3. To keep roleplay productive, inclusive, and fun, participants are expected to maintain emotional distance between themselves and the characters they choose to write. Members will refrain from excessive gloating, hostility or passive aggression, inappropriate outbursts, and poor sportsmanship. Participants who cannot maintain necessary emotional distance may have their characters removed from the scene at the discretion of the moderators.  
4. To allow for easily discovering background information and context for characters a members see being written, members are expected to use individual sub-accounts per character, and post content related that character using their associated sub-account.  
5. To protect members from harassment, protect our site from manipulation, ensure that members can easily contact each other, and prevent ban evasion, members are expected to have only a single main account, with all other accounts they use associated as sub-accounts of that account.  
6. To ensure that members are not subjected to content they do not wish to view, members are expected to provide trigger warnings at the top of each post they write that identify any violent, erotic, or otherwise potentially triggering content it may contain.  
7. To ensure that all members have equal opportunity to exercise autonomy over their characters, members are not generally permitted to write characters with powers that intrinsically subvert this autonomy, such as Lessa’s TKl, mental manipulation, Hear All Dragon/Firelizards/Whers.  
8. To enable a broad range of stories to be told, members are permitted to write characters who are unlikeable, flawed, or who otherwise violate other character’s boundaries, but only to the extent that they do not violate the boundaries of other members in the process.  
9. To ensure that members have an equal opportunity to develop their characters according to their own designs, members are expected to communicate and obtain consent from a character’s writer before writing any content that significantly affects that character, such as having another character assigning punishments, initiate sex, or commit assault or some other significant crime.

# Guidelines Rewrite

1. **Help writers succeed, not characters.** Your characters should be ambitious, feel pain, and hold grudges. To write these things well requires empathy, but don’t let your empathy for your character interfere with your empathy for the real people you write with. Celebrate other’s well-written triumphs and help engineer comebacks from failure, *especially* for your character’s enemies.  
2. **Post your own writing.** When a user disengages from the creative process by plagiarizing writing from elsewhere, not only does writing quality suffer, but they become less able to usefully discuss it and collaborate with other users.  
   1. **No AI posts.** Any of this site’s users could roleplay with their own AI chatbot if they wanted to; users come here to roleplay with real people.  
   2. **Non-original images are ok.** This is a community for writing, so our rules for non-writing content are more relaxed. Drawing or commissioning your own artwork (e.g. for your profile) is admirable and encouraged, but not required.  
3. **Be patient.** Allow other writers room to respond to your posts in their own time. We all have lives outside this community and have to prioritize other things over just writing.  
   1. **Don’t ping excessively.** A second reminder ping sooner than 7 days after the first is usually excessive.  
   2. **Respect your commitments.** If or when you can’t — whether for time reasons, writer’s block, or anything else — communicate and find solutions instead of ghosting.  
4. **Provide content warnings.** When applicable, provide a content warning at the head of each post about the sexual, violent, or otherwise potentially-triggering content it contains. Don’t get your partner fired at work because they had a spare minute and were trying to respond to you.  
5. **Respect character autonomy.** Other members invest time and emotional energy in engaging with their characters. Don’t rob other writers their opportunity to engage and have fun writing by writing their character’s actions or dialogue for them.  
   1. **No mind control.[^1]** Character autonomy is an out-of-character rule, and stories that can’t be told without violating it are out of scope regardless of whether or not they would be consistent with in-character canon.  
6. **When in doubt, communicate.** It’s never wrong to give other users a heads-up of what you’re planning, but some things need to be discussed or even explicitly consented to first.  
   1. **Violate only character boundaries.** Obtain consent from a character’s writer before initiating sex with the character, assaulting them, or doing anything else that would require a content warning.  
   2. **Respect plot-scale autonomy.** Discuss in advance, any injuries, punishments, or other details that will have a major impact on how the other writer will need to write their character going forward.

# Moderation

Destiny Weaves staff apply the following guidelines when moderating the community and responding to incidents. While these guidelines help us to enforce the rules more effectively, all moderation decisions are ultimately judgment calls. We may depart from these guidelines if we feel that the community's interests are better served by an alternative approach. We recognize four broad categories of incident:

* When members don't understand the community, they may have **etiquette problems**. We aim to educate these members so that they can be properly integrated into our culture. If this approach fails after multiple attempts, the matter may be handled as a Hostility issue on the grounds that the whole community is being disrespected. Examples of etiquette issues include posting in the wrong forum thread, low-quality writing, or misusing technical features of the platform.  
* Members have **hostility problems** when they disrespect other members or the community at large. Examples of hostility issues include insults, unconstructive criticism, or inappropriate advertising. In these situations, our response will focus on protecting the community's norms and shutting down inappropriate behavior. While minor hostility problems may be handled informally, expect repeated incidents to lead to a formal warning. Once a formal warning is issued, any further rule violations will lead to a ban.  
* **Malice problems** happen when a member demonstrates that they are fundamentally incompatible with our community's values. Examples of malice problems include true threats, sexual harassment, or hate speech. All malice issues will lead to an immediate ban without warning, regardless of a member's prior history.  
* Finally, we recognize **life problems**, such as inappropriate venting or support-seeking, as a distinct category. Destiny Weaves is a friendly and welcoming community, but we cannot provide counseling, medical advice, or excessive life help. Accordingly, we will dissuade or prevent members from seeking inappropriate support within Destiny Weaves. The moderation team values compassion and sensitivity and will tailor its approach to a member's circumstances.

We use timeouts, formal warnings, and bans as part of our enforcement processes. Please note the following:

* Timeouts are never a "step" in the disciplinary process.  
* However, moderators may issue timeouts if they feel they would improve a situation or prevent it from worsening.  
* When formal warnings are issued, they will always be clearly marked as "formal".  
* A formal warning may be withdrawn, at moderator discretion, if a member shows significant and sustained improvement.  
* A member who continues to cause problems after being formally warned will be banned.  
* Bans never expire unless lifted by the Curator. The Curator will only lift a ban if they are convinced that doing so is in the community's interest, and may refuse to hear an appeal for any reason.  
* Destiny Weaves will not accept appeals on behalf of third parties. Appeal requests should be emailed to [`example@example.com`](mailto:example@example.com)

# Founding

This community was founded by (xxxx) in May 2024\. These governance principles are based on model rules copied from the World Showcase discord community. (credit the site theme and code)

[^1]:  Mind control could, perhaps, be used in the same sense as non-magical abuse or mental illness, but unless victim-control and detailed empathetic rationalization was already your assumption for how mind control writing should work, you’re not even a candidate for participating in a mind-control scene much less writing a character with a mind-control power.
