# Smithcraft

Smithcraft is another major and important craft in Pern. It also happens to be one of the most respected crafts on Pern. Smiths will tackle everything from refining ores to making tools and even delving into making jewelry. As almost every Craft relies on Smithcraft to make their tools and instruments \[except musical instruments as they’re solely done by Harpers\] it's not surprising that anyone with a Smithcrafter in the family will boast about it.  Smithcraft also has one of the few working water wheels on Pern.

The main Crafthall for Smithcraft is North of Telgar Hold, right on the bank of the Telgar River. A notoriously fast flowing river which powers the water wheels of the Smithcraft. 

## History

### Sixth Pass

With a large number of crafters dying to the plague, Smithcraft took up a recruitment drive to encourage the healthy to join their ranks. Given the need for the tools and supplies that Smithcraft could do, this drive was pretty successful.

### Sixth Interval - Long Interval

In a drive to try and improve their stocks and a wave of innovation that swept across Pern with the population boom after the plague. One Smith had the bright idea to bake blackrock and wood in sealed pots over a heat. What was produced was wood-coke\[charcoal\] and coke \[coal coke\] which burned far cleaner than wood or coal in its base form. 

This in turn had an effect on the ores refined by heat, as an example making iron that had less impurities, much to the delight of smiths. With this new fuel for refinement, Smiths went on to experiment more and began combining ores and minerals to see what they could make, then they tested them out for various uses. One of their inventions was Brass. At first, smiths thought they had created gold but there were several key differences between the two metals. The new metal was much easier to damage than gold, when dropped it didn't make the same sound as Gold, when etching acids were applied the acids became discolored and some even fizzed up. When this new metal was introduced to Pern, there was a mass outcry for more of this lustrous metal. 

Experimenting with this new alloy and adding Zinc to the smelting mix, they found that Brass was both made stronger and more flexible, although it did change the color a bit. Bronze was also discovered by combining zinc, copper and Tin. The original creator wanted this alloy to be named something different but its color was so similar to bronze dragons he was quickly overwritten by others who kept calling it Bronze. 

With a new craft being made in Sixth Interval Dragoncraft which specialized in all things to do with Dragons, Whers and Firelizards, Smithcraft assisting in the project meant that a lot of stone and other ores for massive undertaking. With the requirement of the hall being for dragonhealing, Smiths took it upon themselves to start trying to work out _how_ they’d pipe in water into the building, as the healers would need a way to clean wounds and wash their hands without having to carry in large volumes of water. With several experiments on different materials and previous knowledge \[and a little digging into what the Weyrs used\], they decided on a ceramic pipe that was molded and fired in Kilns back at the Main Crafthall and transported _carefully_ to the Hall. With a new innovation of rubber being used to seal the pipes together, Smiths were worried that the rubber would leech into the water so they used a previously treated waterskin hide to stop the rubber leaching anything nasty into water used for the general population. 

Dragoncraft was not charged for this ‘little’ addition as Smithcraft felt that they would pay it back tenfold by keeping the dragons in tiptop shape during threadfall and instead swallowed the charge from the other crafts for the materials.

Davi was succeeded by Rikard who was then succeeded by Mos. Mos was succeeded by Kulos. 

### Seventh Pass

With Minecrafters bringing in dragonglass to see if it would refine into something useful, Smiths noted that the dragonglass under heat didn’t really change into alloy or metal but upon breaking it, it made a wickedly sharp edge that stayed sharp, Healercraft was the first Craft to see what it could be used for, requested they be made into tools for repair surgeries, and then were followed by Weavercraft who wanted them being made into cutters for hides, furs and fabrics. 

After a Smith wondered about putting certain fluids under pressure to see if it changed, a smith managed to create a pressurizing pedal operated pump. Unfortunately a few other smiths were harmed in the process. But the reaction among the smiths seemed to say that was quite normal and they’d learn not to be in harm’s way, much to the disdain of the on site healer!

With the flamethrowers at the Weyr starting to break down, a request from Smithcraft hall was put in for more iron ore to be able to remake the broken parts of the flamethrowers. However the issue was getting the chemical into the metal jars on the flamethrower with enough pressure that it sprayed out rather than dripped which ran the risk of causing the jars to explode. 

#### Craftmaster

Kulos was succeeded by Folami.

### Seventh Interval

New invention of an ore crusher that was powered by steam, although very useful it was decided that the production cost far outweighed the usefulness of it. However refining the correct edge for healer use would mean that it would have to be shipped off to a Smithcrafter first. 

Minecrafters came across what they had thought was interestingly coloured iron from the sulfur pit, although it was more lustrous than iron and had a metallic shine that had a gold tinge. It was sent onto Smithcraft for refinement and identification. Smithcraft let them know that it was a new metal and had been named after the miner that found it and the smithcrafter that refined it, Nikel. 

With the new creation of several alloys, the demand for new ores was requested. A discovery by some of the Smiths refining ores was that making certain ores together like zinc, coal coke, iron and manganese would make a strong iron that was almost rust resistant and had enough flex that wouldn’t shatter like some metals. Admittedly a few smiths messed up in the beginning by mixing too much coal coke into the iron and it would result in shatters of matte iron that they called slag iron but reheating it and adding more iron to the mix would make it stronger than just plain iron.

#### Craftmaster

Folami was succeeded by Gadisa, who was then succeeded by Kamau. Kamau was succeeded by Kisembo.

### Eighth Pass

Mass upgrade project for the crafthalls in progress. 

#### Craftmaster

Kisembo is looking for their replacement.
