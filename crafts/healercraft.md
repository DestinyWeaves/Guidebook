Healercraft is the craft specialized in the treatment of all bodily injuries, diseases, and disorders.

## Jobs

Practitioners of healercraft, **Healers**, ordinarily practice their craft at their assigned hospital or clinic. Every Weyr and all major Holds have at least one such medical center.

**Weyrhealers** are those with training in combat medicine, who accompany wings into the field to provide front-line medical support while intercepting thread. When possible, gold riders are trained as weyrhealers — but not all weyrhealers are necessarily even riders. Many are instead trained healers who ride tandem with available gold riders who have yet to finish their own weyrhealer training.

Healercraft has a wide range of diverse specialties, but a few specialties are especially common.

**Midwives** specialize in childbirth, caring for pregnant women, newborns, and their mothers.

**Dragonhealers** specialize in care not for humans, but for dragons, whers, and firelizards.

**Mindhealers** occupy the  Psychologist/therapist training and are very in their specialty just like a modern mental health professional.

### Medical Specialties

* Obstetrics/midwifery  
* Dental  
* Surgeons/Chirugeons - Repair surgery only  
  * Germ theory and ‘antibiotics’ is beginning to make a resurgence.  There the “Cure-all” medicines are early versions of that. Basically 


##### Lost Techniques

* Blood transfusions & Blood Typing  
  * Healers are aware that people are not always ‘compatible’,with each other sometimes.

## Emergent and Urgent Care

During the 7th interval, it was standard practice for healers to call on riders to transport them to patients in need of emergency treatment. With the start of the 8th Pass, however, this is no longer possible outside of the weyrs themselves — within holds, many injuries that could have been dealt with easily by a specialist must now be dealt with locally by a more general practitioner, or wait for a specialist to travel via road.

 ; many injuries that  weyrs have stopped this has had to change  

 With the start of the 8th Pass, Pern’s Dragonriders have shifted from the usual ‘courier’ and ‘carriage’ style services common in turns proceeding the turns. Weyrlings learning to fly straight might might be used to fetch and carry people and things, but after a point they might also be used to get important folks once they are newly graduated from WEyrlinghood.

## Pharmacopeia

As one of the most important tools of their craft, each healer possesses a personal Pharmacopeia; a thick tome giving the directions and methods for identifying useful plants, preparing and compounding them into medicines, and applying them to and otherwise treating the ailments they are used for.

During a healer’s training as a student, the student is meant to gain at least a passing familiarity with every ailment they could be called on to treat — even ones too rare for them to reasonably encounter in person during their training. Therefore, it’s tradition that every student of healercraft personally transcribe their own complete pharmacopeia from their master’s. Completing this initial transcription is often considered one of the prerequisites for someone to be considered ready to walk the tables as a journeyman healer, and a healer will continue to add to theirs throughout their career.

### Treatments

Refer to \[Flora and Fauna of Pern\] for a description of the herbs most commonly included in a healer’s pharmacopeia. Beyond herbal remedies, though…

**Blood transfusions** can help a patient undergoing surgery, or who has otherwise experienced critical blood loss. Healers on pern are aware of the risk of incompatibility, so when possible a blood relative of the patient should be used; but there’s no systematic understanding of blood typing beyond that.

### History

Healercraft is one of the oldest Crafts on Pern. The colonists brought with them many different medical specialists and medicine was one of the first programs for which they started apprenticing boys and girls interested in the craft. Once the children had basic training in first aid, those who showed particular aptitude were encouraged to go on to further study in different disciplines.

Children and adults had to learn what plants and which animal bites or scratches were toxic in their new world. The ships brought many medicinal plants from Earth and First Centauri, which the colonists were able to adapt to Pernese soil as hybrid species. All the seasoning herbs and spices from the two worlds grew in the soil or in hydroponics tanks. Native herbs and shrubs underwent thorough tests to determine their uses in healing or cookery. Some discoveries were made by accident, such as that of numbweed.

Healercraft currently doesn't have the technology to sustain humans with serious genetic issues so genetic disorders that require a lot of medical intervention would not exist for long. Humanity itself has mutated somewhat over the years with the incorporation of boron into their diet as well as other native flora and fauna. Pernese humans live long lives and are still active in their eighth decade. Most of their ailments are a result of their environment.

Many of the medical emergencies among the colonists were broken bones and births. The doctors taught field surgery to their apprentices who showed the most aptitude and had the strongest stomachs. Obstetricians got plenty of practice at their specialty. Pern grew from a population of 15,023 humans to thousands more within a few years. Since many had been living more healthfully, there were no terrible wasting diseases to decimate their numbers. The causes of cancer had been pinpointed and largely wiped out. Other degenerative conditions had been bred out of the race over the centuries. For those who still smoked before the colony embarked, a non nicotine smoking substitute was distributed to help them break the habit. Tobacco was not considered important enough to grow in the newly tilled fields when foodstuffs were so much more desperately needed. There are still some substances smoked, but are non-nicotine based, such as dragonweed, which produced a ‘high’ and has anti anxiety and depression fighting properties. 

### Facilities

The main diagnostic center and surgical hospital was in Landing. Partway through the ninth year of the colony, all the main hospital functions were moved up to Fort Hold. Benden Hold, too, had hospital facilities when it started out, but those shrank down to a few healers who sent their difficult cases, and their apprentices, back to Fort. A doctor and at least a couple of nurses were assigned to each of the southern stakeholds, but each of these had other jobs, as well. Anyone who suffered from a condition that his local doctor could not handle was sledded into Landing. All the training facilities were maintained in the centers.

Healer Hall is administered by the Craftmaster Healer. Under them are Masters of the different disciplines  of Healing, whose specialties and ranks can be read by the rank cords on their shoulders. The Craftmaster Healer also oversees stewards who take care of stocking supplies, keeping the Hall clean, and preparing food. Another of their assistants is the Nursing Master, a nurse with teaching skill and administrative ability. There are doctors and nurses and apprentices of diagnostics, pediatrics, geriatrics, obstetrics, urology, pharmacy, dentistry, surgery, and respiratory ailments. Gifted Master-healers become specialists in one of these facets of the craft. Some remain at the Hall to teach; others find posts where such a specialty is needed. Each Weyr has at least one urologist and a surgeon.

Not all trained healers have specialties. Some, especially those who are sent to remote holds, are general practitioners. Because of the difficulty of moving seriously ill patients, a specialist is generally brought in by the Masterhealer of a Hold or Weyr instead of risking losing the patient on the journey. On occasion, a healer may call in a dragon to do an emergency ambulance run if there is sufficient cause. It is a very serious matter to summon a dragon, and no healer will do it lightly twice, since the dragons have duties elsewhere. Most emergencies can be handled on a local level.

A healer will pass news of anything new or unusual back to the Hall through the Journeyman Harpers who pass through, or by informing the Lord Holder, who will see that word is sent back.

When a medical emergency arises, the Healer Hall studies the problem and publishes or distributes the means for curing or controlling it. In the case of the Great Plague that wiped out half the population of Pern, Masterhealer Capiam, who was a Master diagnostician, was forced to treat the symptoms empirically at first instead of suggesting a cure. Many medical techniques have been lost or have fallen out of favor over the centuries.

### Education

Healers learn new techniques by returning to the Healer Hall for refresher courses. As in any Craft, a healer *walks the tables* to advance in grade. One may train all the way up to Journeyman rank in one of the other Healer Halls on Pern, such as that in Southern Hold or in South Telgar, but must still return to the main Healer Hall to attain mastery. It is common for apprentices to learn their basic skills in the Hall and be sent out to other Holds as journeymen under masters who are specialists in certain fields. Unlike all other Crafts but the Beastcraft, Healercraft must rely on on-the-job training for its students.

Midwifery is a specialty that many apprentices take up, since the skill is needed in every hold on Pern. Most healers get at least basic instruction in delivering babies.

Nursing is the Journeyman stage of a healer's education. Some remain nurses, and some who attain mastery of their Craft go on to become doctors known throughout Pern for their expertise. There is no guarantee of a healer's competency just because he had his training in the Healer Hall of Pern, but the noncompetitive atmosphere means that a candidate stands or falls on his own skills.

The head nurse has responsibility for a stated number of beds or wards in the great Healer Hall complexes. He or she is in charge of journeymen and journeywomen nurses and dressers. There are Master Nurses in the craft, but every healer needs to be exposed to all facets of his occupation to have a thorough grasp of it.

Healers control most chronic ailments with the help of maintenance dosages of cordials and home remedies. A wine cup of distilled hyssop every day keeps away respiratory problems such as croup. Willow tea keeps arthritis under control. A glass of wine is thought to keep the blood thin. Alfalfa tea is good for the stomach and acts as a diuretic. A preparation of yarrow is good against acne. The archives are full of herbal and homeopathic cures that can be made with the plants that grow throughout Pern.

### Euthanasia and Suicide

The Pernese do not attach any social stigma to suicide. In the case of a terminally ill patient, the decision whether to employ euthanasia is in the hands of the healer, his Master, and the patient, if he is conscious and in his right mind. A Lord Holder does not get involved when a man makes the decision to take a «mercy draught.» A person's death is considered to be a private matter. If a patient is suffering from a terminal ailment, he or she can choose to die—there is no question of whether or not a man is responsible for his own continued existence. Suicide is expected (though not encouraged) behavior in the Weyrs when a fighter loses his dragon to injuries or illness. When riders die, their dragons suicide by going between.

### Mental Health

Anyone who is unhappy is encouraged to seek out someone with whom he can discuss his problems. Healers who help soothe troubled minds follow in the footsteps of the Ancient psychologists and psychiatrists who came to Pern in the colony ships. If a holder disagrees with everybody and everything, he can leave his Hold of birth and start afresh somewhere else. He is not trapped in one place until the end of his life. Even during the Present Pass, there is still a lot of untenanted land and unused space to pioneer.

### Key Locations

Healercraft's main hall is based in Fort Seahold for ease of travel by boat. 

## Chronology

### Eighth Pass

Current project in Healerhall is to create more Olicure and Julcure as well as powdered no-fungus and salves of no-fungus for use out in Pern. 

#### Craftmaster

Telind is still Masterhealer of Pern but is getting very old and frail.

### Seventh Interval

Olinen, taking over from Julan, read through his notes and found that he'd also been in the process of trying to work out why those that ate some forms of moldy bread didn't seem to get sick and if they did get sick, they recovered quicker. Turned out that it was a particular mold growth on bread that seemed to have the best results and careful cultivation of this mold made another cure-all. However it's noted that the Olinen cure-all seemed to work on some infections whereas Julan's cure-all worked on others but it was impossible to tell which would work for the first few days of sickness. 

They ended up being renamed, Julam's cure-all become Julcure and Olinen's cure-all became known as Olicure. When Olinen passed away, Daen took up his work seeing if other fungi and molds would do the same, although he went into dairy molds as they were known to be safe to eat. Upon further research it was summarized that one form of mold that grew on a wheel of cheese seemed to stop any other fungus growing. Daen did as all 'good' researchers did and tested it on himself. To his surprise, his lungs felt clearer and his wheezy lungs felt stronger. So Daen believed he'd created something that would aid in healing the lungs. This wasn't quite the case but in cases of 'Wheezy Lung' it did seem to cure them, but not all cases. Daen's mold treatment for wheezy lungs was deemed as good for when a known fungus took root in the lungs and caused breathing issues. Daen then called his discovery a no-fungus. With a few selected healers, they took the no-fungus out and used it known fungal infections like **Runners' Feet**, although modifications had to be made to make it into a salve to treat the foot issue.

#### Craftmasters

Olinen, succeed by Daen, succeed by Enran, succeed by  Telind.

### Seventh Pass

New powder was made that seemed to have a good effect on the seasonal illnesses that went around. But it does involve mixing some caustic chemicals with herbal powders then pressing them into little discs to take as tablets. This was the new discovery by Julan who was desperate to find something to cure his friend. Although he found a cure, a later experiment with similar chemicals cost him his life. This new pill was called a cure-all. 

Dragonglass has become the instrument of choice for repair surgeries.

*Fur & Fume Lung* began to be studied more extensively as people began to become aware of its effects on the body.

#### Craftmasters

Julam, was succeed by Olinen

### Sixth Interval - Long Interval

With the recent sickness still fresh, serums of vaccine were made up and harvests of medicinal herbs, needlethorn and redwort due to depleted stores. 

The Smithcrafters & Minercrafters had begun to present with new symptoms. It was small pockets of people at first, those who worked in various sections. But then one or two people because four or five, clusters of symptoms. This lead to the categorizing of illnesses from working in, with and around metals often collectively called :Metal-sickness, as the symptoms were often interrelated.

Then came the Glasscrafters, the sand and metal and heat-related illnesses beginning to appear in the same sort of small pockets as the Miners and Smiths called *Sand Lung*. This was due to the types of ore being mined and processed and special breathing masks had to be invented for the continued mining and smithing of these metal ores.

#### Craftmaster

Capiam, succeed by Pader, succeeded by Zoris, succeed by Julam.

### Sixth Pass

Plague hit Pern hard, taking out Crafters, Holders, Weyrfolk and Riders alike. Thanks to the hard work of healerhall and its Masterhealer, Capiam they were able to get it under control. Especially with the issue of succession at Fort Hold, as Lord Tolocamp refused to name an heir during his sickness. Healerhall was credited with making a serum vaccine that effectively ended the plague at the end of the sixth pass.  

#### Craftmaster

Olvinan, succeed by Capiam
