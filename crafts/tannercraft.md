# Tannercraft

Tannercraft is another traditional Craft but is also one of the crafts that a lot of people have some limited knowledge in as everyone knows something about curing hides, but the best cured and/or dyed leathers, hides and furs come from those trained in Tannercraft. A true Tannercraft Masters hands are a rainbow of assorted colors and often permanently dyed from handling dyes and curatives used on the hides and leathers.. 

The main Crafthall is located in Igen Hold, on the outskirts and generally down wind of the Hold to help stop the smells hitting the Holders. .

## History

Generally speaking most Tannercrafters use Salt for curing their hides, with access to the ocean to get hold of salt easily its no wonder that salt cured hides are a staple for the Tannercraft. Every Major Hold and Weyr has a tanner-trained cobbler working full time to maintain footwear. Weyrs also have a Tanner who’s trained in producing and curing Wherhides and leathers for Riders who need to get the material to make their straps. It is well known that some riders pay the Weyr Tannercrafter to make their straps for them. 

Much like cooking, winecraft and masonry, Tannercraft is considered a hold craft. The rough work of fashioning a harness, riding garments and furniture covers is easily learned and passed on. But to maintain crafthold prestige, the Master Tanners have craft secrets and techniques to make finer, softer and more supple leathers. Many of the dyes used by Tannercraft are trade secrets and while a good portion of the dyes are solely for shoe and boot leathers, there are some dyes for other products produced by the Craft. 

It's also a well known fact that Tannercraft and Weavercraft have an ongoing rivalry, that is friendly… some of the time. 

### Sixth Pass

With the archival flood sweeping through, Master Shemmia promptly started a push to have all the craft secrets written down, copied and placed in each of their Crafthalls around Pern to ensure that no techniques would be lost. But when Pebarmast came into position, he wanted those secrets locked down to ensure that no-one would steal them and had gotten Smithcraft to make special lockboxes to ensure that no-one without his knowledge or permission would get access to the craft secrets.  

#### Craftmaster

Shammia succeed by Pebarmast

### Sixth Interval - Long Interval

With the unsettled nature of the weather of the Sixth pass, it was decided by Master Pebarmast to begin looking into better waterproofing the hides and leathers that the Tannercraft was famous for. The hides and leathers were mostly waterproof already but it would fail where the stitches were. So they looked into several different methods to overcome this issue. Even looking into see if they could make the leathers and hides self healing to an extent. This fell flat and when Pebarmast turned senile, Tofraki took over. 

Rather than a hide or leather that was self healing, they created a compound that could be spread over where the stitches were and once it dried would make those seams waterproof. However the process technique was particularly smelly and made many of the Crafters sick, the other side effect was that if not quickly washed off the hands, it would ‘eat’ through the skin. There was also with the new chemical and raw materials produced by Smithcraft and Minecraft, a number of new dyes were also made that bring in much brighter colors as well as being sun and weather resistant and wouldn’t fade as readily as some of the old dyes. But these new dyes could make a Crafter sick if they were not careful. 

#### Craftmaster

Pebarmast succeed by Tofraki who was then succeed by Diza. Diza was succeed by Kima. 

### Seventh Pass

Master Kima in her final Turns noted that during the Pass, lots of hide and leathers were requested by Weyrs because of threadscoring and started a project to see if there was anything they could put onto the leathers and hides to make it at least have some resistance to threadscoring. When Badu became Craftmaster, they continued this project. 

#### Craftmaster

Kima succeed by Badu.

### Seventh Interval

Master Badu believed that they may have cracked the needed component to making leathers and hides resistant to threadscoring but unfortunately died before they could properly test it. Grichego also did testing of the coating against different acids, and refined it to allow dyes to penetrate the hides and leathers. Upon making Craftmaster, Ubeal set off samples of the coating to the Weyrs to see if the coating made any difference to flame score and when the time came, to see if it would work against Threadscore. The new coating was indeed flame resistant, but they had no way of testing it against Thread. However it was noted that the coating would need to be reapplied every 4 months as Sun and weather broke down the coating and rendered it useless. 

#### Craftmaster

Badu succeed by Grichego, who was then succeeded by Ubeal. Ubeal was succeeded by Gallu.

### Eighth Pass

Current project of threadscore resistant coating to hide and leather is awaiting testing. All riders riding leathers and harnesses have this coating as it is proven to be flame retardant. 

#### Craftmaster

Gallu is looking for their replacement.
