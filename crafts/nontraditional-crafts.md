# Runner Stations

THe Runnerstations is another very traditional Craft in Pern. With a combination of long distance running by people and the use of Runnerbeasts, means that a lot of Runners work closely with Beastcrafters to get good beasts for their work. Runners quite literally serve as the mail people of Pern for those who don’t have firelizards or dragons. They provide the main form for long distance communication for those without dragons, whers or firelizards. Most Runners have long legs, some are better for sprinting short distances quickly, whilst others can be good at long distance running. 

They tend to take well maintained trails that are called Traces that link into all Major and Minor Holds as well as Linking up with a Station that sits on Weyr patrol routes so families are able to communicate with family members outside and in the Weyrs. It's a known fact that these stations are also used by those wishing to avoid public identification, just as long as the fee for carrying the message is covered. It is craft policy that Community messages are always carried for free, with the station Master having the power to decide which messages are deemed as Community messages. 

The main Crafthall for Runner training is in Fort Hold, although there are stations all over Pern.

Runnercraft is a very static craft, so other than conveying messages and delivering supplies, packages and parcels, they would not be doing anything different throughout the ages.

# Trader

Although considered a craft by many, it actually isn’t a Craft at all. Instead there are several groups that train their family members in how to haggle and trade wares for Holds, Weyrs and Crafthall for a price. All traders learn to survive outside the Hold, and during a Pass they seek shelter in whatever Hold they’re near to. 

Perhaps the biggest bragging right of the Tradergroups is their links to the first Settlers, although no-one can prove or disprove these claims. The main families trading are Lilcamp, Western Trade, Igen Trade and Amhold traders. 

As there is no hall to learn how to be a trader, you have to get in good with the Trade groups in operation. It is well noted that when Traders come into the Holds, there are often Gathers held as the influx of new goods brought in by the caravans are often well received and sought after.
