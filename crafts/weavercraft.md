# Weavercraft

Weavercraft is technically two crafts rolled into one, with fabric weavers and tailors, and for this, although both would fall under the same Crafthall, they’re specialized forms has resulted in Weavercraft using two crests to mark its Crafters. One is a lavender loom on a white background, and the other is a lavender stool with a needle in it on a white background. 

Weavercraft hall is located in Southern Boll Hold and has had a surprising effect on the Hold, rather than being solely focused on growing food crops, the Hold has nearly half of its farmland dedicated to growing Flax, cotton and Sisal \[pernese fiber that is almost like silk\]. Although it also well known that both specialisations will delve into the other during their training. 

## History

### Sixth Pass

With the archival flood and the Wild fires that ran rampant, where a number of fabrics were stored was burned to the ground. This began a massive push from the Craft to get those supplies back up to safe levels. Old techniques that were written and lost in archival Flood and wild fires, the people who’d done them and were retirement were summoned back to the Crafthold and paid generously to write the techniques down so that the knowledge wouldn’t lost forever. This made it that Weavercraft lost the least amount of techniques and patterns. With looms in every Hold, Hall and Weyr, this makes Weavercraft perhaps one of the most successful and wide spread crafts in Pern, but with these crafters being so wide spread, it also means that many Holds, Halls and Weyrs will make their own hand looms, crochet hooks, knitting needles, spindles and shuttles for making what they need on the fly and with the loss of the stored fabrics in the storage caverns these skills were needed more than ever. .

Huge push into refilling the storage caverns was put into place as many fabrics were lost to the floods and fires.

#### Craftmaster

Raki succeed by Lastan.

### Seventh Interval

Still making fabrics to refill the storage caverns, it was noted that Tannercraft had released a coating that was flame retardant and thought to be thread resistant. So crafters began working on something similar to allow their fabrics to be on par with the leather, hides and furs created by Tannercraft. 

#### Craftmaster

Lastan succeed by Voimo, who was then succeeded by Trailan. Trailan was succeeded by Carra.

### Eighth Pass

This craft is looking to have their own flame resistant fabric coating tested and see how it holds up in Threadfall. 

#### Craftmaster

Carra is looking for their replacement.
