# Glasscraft
Glasscraft is another traditional craft, with long standing roots in making glass for lanterns, windows and goblets. They're considered some of the bravest crafters in Pern due to their regular dealing with molten glass. Due to the sands used, apprentice glass always has a green hue to it, whereas Journeyman glass would be clear, but only Masters would glass that were other colors than green or clear.

The Crafthall for glasscraft is in Ista Hold, near the fine sand pits of Ista Hold. The sand here is considered of the highest quality but still takes turns of practice and training to work correctly. 

## History

### Sixth Pass
Glasscrafting was undergoing a change as many crafters were experimenting with different products in the glass to see if it'd change how the glass forms or its coloring. However, the fact that the apprentice's blown glass was green remained true.

### Sixth interval - Long Interval
During a surprise thunderstorm, glasscrafters at the Ista sand pits saw lightning strike the sand pit. The glasscrafters then noticed that the ground was smoking and upon digging found a clump of hot glass. waiting, they carefully uncovered it and brought it out. Inspecting they had noted that glass was almost Master quality with its clarity but its shape left much to be desired. So an experiment took place across the sand pits. With it being known that Iron is great for a lighting rod, they sunk several iron beams in one of the lesser quality sand pits and waited for a lighting storm. The experiment was a success and they were able to get several high quality clumps of glass out of it. However an issue then came up when they tried to reform the glass into something usable. The furnaces they used didn't get to a high temperature to remelt the glass to the right temperature to keep the lighting glass quality. They tried using their current methods, but the lighting glass often shattered in the furnace or broke during the blowing process. Speaking with several smiths and even some dragonriders, they attempted to find a solution. 

A glassscraft trained rider stopped by the Crafthall with his blue dragon, Kulth who had been in Thread drills unfortunately Blue Kulth hadn't gotten rid of all the firestone sludge from his second stomach and ended up vomiting the sludge near one of the furnaces trying to melt the lighting glass. To everyone's surprise, the firestone sludge reacted to the flames of the furnace and the flames got hotter than normal. Glasscrafters then put in a request to Ista Weyr for a small sampling of the firestone sludge to test if the sludge in the furnace was a fluke or if it was something that could be replicated. This then compounded another issue, the current furnaces were unable to handle the heat of new fuel mix and were cracking. This then began a new project to make the furnaces better. The fix was quite a surprise to all. In talks with Smithhall, Glassscrafters got hold of some quartz stone and put it on the base of the furnace with the knowledge that quartz stone didn't seem to melt at the temperatures they reached, they then opted to try a quartz furnace. It was a costly endeavor but the payoff could be immense. Trial of the new furnace proved very fruitful and they were able to successfully melt the lighting glass and reform into new items. The added benefit that glass was stronger, able to take knocks and some drops with a beautiful clarity that even put Master blown glass to shame.  

As dragonriders had been helping woodcrafters in creating a more stable and easy to obtain fuel source that had become notoriously scarce during the winter, Glasscrafters realized that these new bricks burned both hot and long with less contamination of the glass melting. An interesting byproduct of using firestone sludge was that containments of firestone sludge could be either a rich cobalt blue, an amber yellow and a deep black glass. It was noted that Amber yellow came from weyrling firestone sludge, cobalt blue was from adult dragons but the black came from dragons that could control their flame very effectively.  

With a new crafthall being built, a good number of glasscrafters were called in to make glass for the new crafthall.
