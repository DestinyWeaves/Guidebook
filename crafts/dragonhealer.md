# Dragon Healercraft
At the beginning of the **6th Interval**, Healers began to specialize in dragon, wher, and firelizard patients exclusively and with the plague’s arrival, that became more nuanced. It was time for a separated Healercraft, the Masters called *Dragoncraft*. 

## Location

### Keroon
Originally part of the Healercraft, a separate Crafthold was founded in <b>I.605.04</b> and built into the Red Butte, with a massive stone crafthall set into the plateau a stone’s throw away from High Reaches Hold and large enough to accommodate the largest of dragons. It was in short, a feat of engineering and many stonemasons were tasked to work under the project until its completion in *I.620.03*. While the crafthold was being built, the Beastcraft folk hosted the Dragonhealers until they were ready to move into their new accommodations.

##  History

### Sixth Interval - Long interval
**I.605.04**-**I.620.03**
A separate craft is founded to look after dragons, whers, and firelizards. It takes a great deal of time to establish the Crafthall in Keroon, but is done with the untiring efforts of many stonemasons and architects over the turns. This project brings more of a population to High Reaches Hold and Weyr as many join together in order to support the building effort. 

#### Craftmaster
Jaellan, the first Dragoncraft Master was succeeded by Irnia, who was then succeeded by Roana, and then taken over by Craftmaster Linae. 

All of the Dragoncraft Masters have been female since its inception though many assistant Craftmasters have been male. This is a profession where women have excelled and maintained their control over many turns, contrary to other disciplines’ decline in women dominating fields, such as Harpercraft and the main discipline of Healing.

### Seventh Pass
In the 7th Pass, Dragonhealers made great strides in treating wing injuries caused by Threadscoring, using a combination of combat glue and dissolving thread that left the wounds cleaner and less susceptible to infection. Many of the women who excelled in this area were trained in different sewing techniques borrowed from the Weavercraft and adapted for cleaner surgical stitching. Dragon anesthetics/pain treatment were also an area that saw a huge boost as they were able to incorporate dragongrass into the treatment process, allowing for more extensive surgery and stitching to be done after the initial injury. This enabled the survival of more of the critically injured dragons, who then went on to produce clutches, adding to the dragon population as it declined with Threadfall, injury, and illness.  

#### Craftmaster
Master Amahle, who began applying Weaver techniques to Dragonhealing that were later used in Healercraft, was succeeded by Master Aileena who continued to make those techniques for suturing wing repair relevant. Wing repair takes off in leaps and bounds with many dragonhealers learning the new techniques, mastering them, and applying them to critically injured dragons. This practice would continue well into the Eighth Pass and beyond and would almost be considered a reconstructive art.

#### Craftmaster
Master Mynna was succeeded by Nirai , Pella, and then Jerlane. Jerlane was a particularly prolific wing surgeon and her work was quite skillfully captured for future generation via a Harper Artist called Nella who was especially talented at capturing Healer works in teaching diagrams that were later published as part of the permanent Records and housed in the main library of the Dragoncraft Hall with copies stored in the Harper archives. Her work was carried on by others who devoted their talents to helping the future generations of Dragonhealers.
