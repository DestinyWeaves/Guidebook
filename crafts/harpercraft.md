# Harpercraft

Crest here

Harpercraft is the oldest of the traditional crafts on Pern. Harpers encompass a few professions such as teachers for teaching children, composers for creating music and songs, singers to sing songs and ballads, instrument and music theory masters for creating the background music of ballads and songs, drummers for passing along messages, archivists for keeping records and updating them as when needed, those who specialize in judging/lawyer work, and finally spies for collecting information. Usually spies are used for the MasterHarper to keep them abreast of new developments across disciplines. It is noted that spies are a secret sub-sect of Harpers and have codenames to ensure their identities remain a secret and that any spy located who speaks of it is instantly dismissed as a troublemaker. There is a sub-sect of As previously mentioned, Harpers that specialize in Law, serving as Judges and Lawyers on Pern. If a Harper chooses to specialize in teaching childhood and/or child development, they’ll be able to do some studies at Healerhall to ensure they’ve got good coverage on the health and well-being side to give the child in their care proper care.

The main hub for Harpers is located in Fort Hold, in their own separate compound just out of Fort Hold. 

## Chronology

### Start of the Eighth Pass

Current project in Healerhall is to create more Olicure and Julcure as well as powdered no-fungus and salves of no-fungus for use out in Pern. 

#### Craftmaster

Dolion, succeeded by Rham

### Seventh Interval

Records updated with the new innovations and experiments. Farmercraft was recorded with their breeding efforts as a number of crops were suffering with poor yields. 

Wotan unfortunately turned senile towards the end of his tenure and was replaced by Quence.

#### Craftmaster

Aadon, succeeded by Wotan, succeeded by Quence, succeeded by Dolion.

### Seventh Pass

With the increase in population, Harpers were under more strain than ever before to keep up with teaching the now flourishing populous. A good number of new Harpers became newly minted as teachers for the Holds, including some going to new Cotholds that had cropped up. 

#### Craftmaster

Zon succeed by Aadon

### Sixth Interval - Long Interval

With new innovations from Glasscraft, Woodcraft, Smithcraft, and Minecraft as well as Beastcraft starting new breeding projects, the outcry for Archivists was surprisingly high, causing a number of Harpers to retrain into the Archivist speciality to ensure that no more valuable information would be lost. Extra copies of all records were also created and transported up to the new council chambers in the Northern Wastes for safe keeping.  

#### Craftmaster

Norm, succeeded by Sellen, succeeded by Cabu, succeeded by Zon.

### Sixth Pass

With all hands on deck during the plague of the sixth pass and spreading the news of vaccine for both human and runnerbeast, the Harpers were instrumental in aiding Healerhall in getting the vaccine rolled out. A huge undertaking of making sure records held as much detail about the plague was put into the Records, including how they believed it started, how quickly it spread, how it was spread, symptoms and how they treated it. Just in case someone needed this information in the future. 

#### Craftmaster

Tirone, succeeded by Norm.
