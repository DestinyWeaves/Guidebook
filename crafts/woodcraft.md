# Woodcraft

Woodcraft is one of the more specialized craft and also the smallest crafthall, with the smallest number of members due to the scarcity of its main resource, Wood. As wood is difficult to keep alive during threadfall, and takes so long to grow, many of the hardwoods are solely reserved for Master use only. The woods that are considered common are the hard and dense Skybroom trees that dominate the Lemos Hold woodland. With wood being so rare and prized, only the richest Holds have truly wooden furniture made from the very protected oak and ash trees grown by the Woodcrafters. These hardwood items are a well known mark of wealth everywhere. Skybroom being so difficult to work with, is only really used in plank form for the framework of buildings. Most conventional furniture used by Hold and Weyr are those that have been passed down from families long since dead. 

Located on the outskirts of Lemon Hold, Lemos Hold has amusingly prospered from this Crafthall having the most amount of wooden furnishing than anywhere else on Pern.

With demand for wood increasing, Woodcrafters begin seeding their beloved woodlands with new hard and softwood trees to grow their woodlands to try and keep up with demand, although they also took to making wicker from the reeds that grew along the river banks to help stretch the demand out. It was at this time that several woodcrafters came across a green ‘forest’, upon hacking through the marsh’s woodland, it was discovered that this new ‘tree’ was hollow
