# Minecraft

Minecraft is the craft specialized in gathering metal ores, blackrock coal, gemstones,  architectural stone, and other minerals; and in excavating and constructing earthworks, tunnels, and underground spaces.

## Jobs

Practitioners of minecraft, **Miners**, ordinarily practice their craft as part of a mine-team, one of several mine-teams that operate a specific mine or quarry in shifts with each other.

Each mine team is led by a **Mine Supervisor**, an experienced practitioner of the craft primarily responsible for keeping their team safe, training its members how to mine effectively, and coordinating their operations with other teams.

Minecraft also includes specialty disciplines involved in constructing and operating a mine. 

**Minesearchers** use their training in geology to identify underground deposits and hazards, and advise on the directions and locations to excavate. This also includes identifying sites for new mines.

**Mine Engineers** design, repair, and operate the tunnels and mechanical equipment common to multiple teams. This includes shoring, ventilation, hoists, mine rail systems, and ore processing equipment like crushers and screens.

**Refiners** and **Metallurgists** straddle the line between Smithcraft and Minecraft, and often have some training in both. They apply physical, chemical, and thermal processes to transform excavated ore into the metal stock that practitioners of Smithcraft use to craft their items.

### Whers

Whers are essential to mine operations, due to their exceptional strength and their ability to sense underground resources and hazards. Most mine operations on Pern are only partially mechanized; Whers and their handlers fill many of those roles instead.

The costs of housing, caring for, and feeding a Wher are immense, but the additional productivity makes those costs easy to justify for an experienced miner. Bonding a Wher is often seen as a prerequisite for promotion to Mine Supervisor. Given the opportunity, miners may in some cases even bond more than one.

The mining crafthall offers grants to those who bond Whers, to offset a member’s initial costs associated with being trained as a Wher-Handler and training a newly-bonded Wher.

## Key Locations

### Crafthall

The crafthall for mining is on the outskirts near Crom Hold. It’s positioned here due to this location’s proximity to several important mineral resources.

### Crom Sulfur Pits

The Crom Sulfur Pits are a series of active hydrothermal vents in the wastes north of Crom Hold, noted for the surface deposits of elemental sulfur, sub-surface veins containing rich sulfide ores, and hazardous toxic gasses that pool there and can easily poison and kill an unwary traveler.

Aside from the sulfur itself, the principal ores found in this location are **Galena** and **Pyrite**, refined respectively to produce lead and iron. Other associated ores at this site are sometimes found and refined to produce nickel and manganese. Deposits of these ores are excavated from now-extinct hydrothermal vent tubes.

Due to the extreme hazards, these sites permit only wher-bonded miners. Protective equipment including a gas mask is mandatory.

### Blackstone Coal Mines

Blackstone is a non-fossil mineral coal unique to Pern. It’s a non-foliated metamorphic rock, found in a near-ubiquitous bed layer deposited around 1500 Mya. Most areas of Pern theoretically have blackstone somewhere underneath them, but accessing a layer that deep often comes with significant challenges.

As a fuel, blackstone coal is clean-burning with a characteristic fixed carbon percentage of 94-96% and a gross calorific value of 14,000-15,000 btu/lb. Due to the high cost, this fuel is rarely used domestically, but it’s essential for ore smelting and still used to fire most of the forges and kilns of Smithcraft and Glasscraft.

### High Reaches

The mines near High Reaches Weyr are the principal source of firestone, essential for enabling dragons to breath fire. The process of mining firestone is especially dangerous; care must be taken to avoid igniting the often explosive atmosphere that develops in the tunnels.

These mines are also the source of most of the obsidian used by Healercraft to make surgical cutting edges.

### Weyrs

The weyrs of pern only rarely allow miners to excavate the caldera formations they are built into, but the igneous rock often contains gemstone-bearing kimberlite formations. Most gemstones on Pern are mined as an incidental product of a construction project meant to expand a weyr.

### Other Mines

Abundant ores for copper, zinc, tin, and gold are present and can be mined in various locations. Alluvial deposits are mined from open pits and riverbeds and refined via panning or sluicing, while exposed lodes are mined from horizontal shafts into a cliff-face or outcropping, or with vertical shafts meant to intercept the same formations further inland.

## Hazards

Minecraft has long been associated with a number of notable health hazards — including long-term health effects, not just the imminent risk of death from poisoning, fire, or collapse.

[**Sand Lung**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicosis) is a respiratory condition common to most practitioners of minecraft, smithcraft, and glasscraft. Modern rules requiring the use of respiratory filters reduce the incidence of this condition somewhat, but it’s still common.

[**Fur Lung**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper\_toxicity) is a more severe respiratory condition unique to copper mining, with symptoms that often don’t appear until years afterward. This disease is characterized by a shortness of breath, a persistent dry cough, chest tightness or pain, dry cracking sounds when inhaling, and fingertips and toes that appear wider and rounder than usual.

[**Fume Fever**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal\_fume\_fever) is a condition most associated with refining brass and zinc, characterized by flu-like symptoms including fever, chills, nausea, headache, and fatigue. Unlike many other mining diseases, this is one that ordinarily passes with a few days bed-rest, and doesn’t seem to cause any long-term health effects except in especially severe cases.

The Chrom Sulfur Pits are home to an especially diverse set of acute and chronic conditions; but most notably [**Corpsey**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead\_poisoning) and [**Manganism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganism).

## Chronology

### Sixth Pass

Mass project was started to ramp up blackrock\[coal\] production as the Winter was unusually harsh. With the increase in production of blackrock, it also meant they were able to keep prices on the same level so that people wouldn't be priced out of being able to heat their homes. However it should be noted that blackrock is still pretty expensive to the average cotholder but it burns longer and hotter than just burning the underbrush they rip out from their cotholds.

### Sixth Interval - Long Interval

Minecraft, having found that a new fuel source created by woodcrafters was pushing blackrock out of favor for home heating, found that they were missing that revenue stream and began to expand their ore and stone searches. Their search proved very fruitful, finding a vein of black diamond, several new ore pits for iron and blackrock and even some deposits of sapphires, emeralds and rubies. But perhaps one of their biggest finds was a sulfur pit just North of Crom up in the Wastes. But mining the sulfur proved not only dangerous but lethal in some cases. It was stated that Wher bonded Miners could go but only with specialist equipment as gasses released by mining the sulfur were so concentrated they burn the eyes and throat, and can eventually dissolve the miners' teeth. 

The added danger of sulfur was that the lake that had formed near the deposit was so dangerous that it would melt almost anything that touched the water's surface. Several expeditions to the lake nearby found that on clear days with little wind, some miners without masks would suffocate and die, others would hallucinate and fall into the water. So mining was only allowed with breathers and padded armor to protect their body. Thankfully Whers were able to provide warning to the miners so now sulfur mining is strictly limited to miners who are bonded with Whers.

With a need for more metals, Miners started working with the Smithcraft to see if maybe combining ores to smelt them down could produce a new material. With several failed experiments, they finally produced a beautiful shiny metal alloy that was very reminiscent of Gold. At first, smiths and miners had wondered if they'd found a way to create gold but there were several key differences between the two metals. The new metal was much easier to damage than gold, when dropped it didn't make the same sound as Gold, when etching acids were applied the acids became discolored and some even fizzed up. So the new metal was named brass and its luster and shine being so similar to gold there was outcry from many to get items made of it. 

Experimenting with this new alloy and adding Zinc to the smelting mix, they found that Brass was both made stronger and more flexible, although it did change the color a bit. Zinc mining was perhaps one of the safer ores to mine, given both its location and only breathing in the dust and fumes caused a short term illness that was called **Fume fever**. It would only last a day or two with symptoms like chills, fever, excessive sweating and muscle weakness. Thankfully this dissipated really quickly and thus far, there have been no long term health effects to Zinc mining.  

Bronze was also discovered by combining zinc, copper and Tin. The original creator wanted to know this alloy was something different but its color was so similar to bronze dragons he was quickly overwritten by others who kept calling it Bronze. However mining copper and tin had its own dangers. Copper was definitely the more dangerous ore to mine with known effects like nerve poisoning and getting a condition called **Fur Lung** which didn't show up for years. Fur lung was a long term health condition caused by numerous professions but commonly found among miners who gathered copper, symptoms included shortness of breath, A persistent, dry cough, Chest tightness and/or pain, Dry and crackling sounds in your lungs when you inhale and fingertips and toes that appear wider and rounder than usual. People with Fur lung could live a while with the symptoms but it is noted that they didn't live as long as others. 

**Sand Lung** was also another health effect that miners could get as well as glasscrafters, smithcrafters, potters and weavers. Although its effects aren't as severe as Fur lung, it has very similar symptoms like: a persistent cough, persistent shortness of breath, weakness and tiredness. Although some medicines can ease the symptoms they are permanent effects that last until death. 

With a new craft being made in Sixth Interval Dragoncraft which specialized in all things to do with Dragons, Whers and Firelizards, Smithcraft assisting in the project meant that a lot of stone and other ores for massive undertaking.

### Seventh Pass

With a increase to metal ore production, several new mines were up around Pern, notably A mine by High Reaches Weyr was proving itself to be an excellent source of dragonglass\[obsidian\], that was proving it very useful to Healercraft as it held a wickedly sharp edge but also quite tough and resistant to shattering when dropped. However refining the correct edge for healer use would mean that it would have to be shipped off to a Smithcrafter first. With the flamethrowers at the Weyr starting to break down, a request from Smithcraft hall was put in for more iron ore to be able to remake the broken parts of the flamethrowers. 

Minecrafters came across what they had thought was interestingly coloured iron from the sulfur pit, although it was more lustrous than iron and had a metallic shine that had a gold tinge. It was sent onto Smithcraft for refinement and identification. Smithcraft let them know that it was a new metal and had been named after the miner that found it and the smithcrafter that refined it, Nikel. 

Another mineral was also discovered at the sulfur pit, a lustrous but crumbly ore that was called Galena after the miner's wife. This however turned out to be a highly toxic mineral that caused a serious health condition that healers named **Corpsey**, so named because sufferers looked like corpses and died pretty soon afterwards. With the boom in new metals being created, a request for a crumbly black ore was requested by Smithcraft, they named it Manganese as they’d combined them into a very useful new metal that was both strong and rust resistant. 

This brought its own issues, as mining it brought up another health condition by breathing in the fumes and dust that caused **Manganese poisoning**. This had long term health effects and effectively ended the careers of the afflicted.

### Seventh Interval

With the innovations of the previous Interval, Miners then worked on safety equipment to keep their miners safe from the known health conditions caused by mining of these minerals and ores. Requests put into Smithcraft and Weavercraft for better breathers and protective clothing to keep their workers safe.

#### Craftmaster

Morvon was succeeded by Xato who was succeeded by Hiko.  When Hiko passed away they were succeeded by Nell

### Eighth Pass

No projects in work for the moment

#### Craftmaster

Nell is still craftmaster although advanced in age and looking for a replacement.
