# Beastcraft
Considered one of the more essential crafts on Pern, Beastcrafters train and study in Keroon and are linked to Igen Hold. They serve as Pern zoologists, veterinarians, microbiologists, geneticists, after Landing these professions were merged into one profession and labeled as 'Beastcrafters', although these specialities still exist they are all held under the umbrella term 'Beastcraft'. There are also specializations that fall to certain animals. 

Herdbeastcrafter which primarily tends to Herdbeasts. Runnerbeastcrafter tend to specialize in tending and breeding Runnerbeasts. Animalhealers which are the vets of Pern and will treat all animals except dragons, firelizards and whers.

## History
No record survives back further from the Sixth Pass due to mass wildfires and flood damage to the Record center. 

### Sixth Pass
Seamen from the ship Windtoss out of Igen Seahold brought in a feline that they found out at sea. They took it to Keroon for identification, unknowingly transmitting a disease that would spread quickly through the Runners that were shipped over to Southern Boll, Telgar and Ruatha. Four days later, the seamen brought the feline to the Gather at Ista, but news had spread from the places that the feline had been causing sickness in Runners as thus the feline was destroyed. Unfortunately the damage was already done as the disease quickly spread unchecked, infecting humans and Runnerbeasts alike, although Dragons and Whers seemed unaffected. 

Symptoms included headaches, fever, chills, a dry hacking cough and heart palpitations. Quarantine was declared and efforts were put in motion to track the exposed animals and destroy them before they further infected other animals. It took until the beginning of the Sixth interval for the disease to finally wear itself out, a large number of breeding stock for Runners were wiped out and a good number of people died as well. Now, all Beastcrafters are trained to look for any sign of this disease particularly to ensure it doesn't come back. 

#### Crafters Master
Sulur died during the plague, and was replaced by Balfor.

### Sixth Interval - Long Interval
With the disease finally over, a mass breeding project was started with trades for breeding animals happening all over, and some wild runners had also been discovered up in the Northern Wastes. These runners were considered a blessing and were swiftly added to the genetic pool of Runners. This resulted in stockier, more hardy Runners that were considered wonderful for draft work on farms. The remaining stock of racing Runners were breed in with some of the newly rediscovered Runners because they at least the Beastcrafters considered them to be immune to the disease. It took a lot of time, but Runnerbeastcrafters finally near the end of the Sixth Interval considered the breeding stock of Runners safe. Work then focused on herdbeasts during this time, as there was a population boom after the Sixth's pass plague outbreak, it was decided that the milk producing herdbeasts weren't producing enough. So a breeding project was started to see if they could get the production rate for Herdbeasts up. With a careful cross of slimmer herdbeast with a stockier herdbeast to allow for milk production and in turn this also brought up meat herdbeasts.

#### CraftMaster
Balfor passed away, replaced by Maziren who passed away and was replaced by Kemir, then Erius and finally Reni took over as Craftmaster. 

### Seventh Pass
With herdbeasts and runners seemingly secure in their stock levels, Beastcraft Hall then moved onto breeding up better furbeasts that were then released into the Wild to bolster the wild stock levels. 

#### Craftmaster
Reni passed away and was succeeded by Cadsoyin. Noran took over Cadsoyin after his death, when Noran died, Rodred took over.

### Seventh Interval
With furbeasts seemingly doing well by the size and quality of fur gained from them improving, Beastcraft Hall then moved onto a breeding program to improve the hide quality of Whersports and Wherries. With the added benefit that this also improved the meat quality gained from both species. 

#### Craftmaster
Rodred was replaced by Bachyar who was then succeeded by Kashaer. 
 
### Eighth Pass
No breeding projects in place at the moment. Beastcrafters are currently reviewing all stock for all domesticated animals for any flaws that could be remedied. 

#### Craftmaster
Kashaer died and was succeeded by Tynzel.
