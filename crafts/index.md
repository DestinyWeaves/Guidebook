# Basic overview of Crafts
The Crafts system on Pern is somewhat loosely based on the medieval system of Guilds. The crafthalls act as establishments that not only train people but are reservoirs of knowledge on a variety of different topics and skills.

With an absence of modern technology, mass communication and the internet, the crafthalls serve as colleges and universities and will research new methods for their craft as well ensuring that old techniques and instructions are preserved.

## The Crafthall System
Each of the crafthalls on Pern adhere to the same basic organizational structure and ranking system. Whilst Crafthalls may be of any size, the largest and oldest halls are considered the main hub for learning the craft and where majority of the research takes place.

Every Crafthall has a Master of Masters, called a Craftmaster. A Craftmaster are viewed as the Head of the Craft and they oversee the Craft as a whole, overseeing activities and education at their establishment. It has been known for Craftmasters pull their people from Holds should their people be mistreated thus crippling a Hold or Weyr, as they’d have only the locals that had received the very basics of training in the Craft. 

**Apprentice** are the beginners in the craft. Apprentices can be as young as 10 but will vary in age. They’re education is mostly handled by Masters, sometimes a senior Journeyman/Journeywoman who have shown promise in training others and are set to permanent posting in the Crafthall.

**Journeyman/Journeywoman** are the trained individuals of the Craft. Making a large portion of the Craft that Pern will see most of. They’re often posted to Hold, Weyr and even other Crafthalls to provide basic training to locals or to offer their skills to their locale.

**Master** are considered the most highly trained members of a Craft. They’re attained a level of expertise in their Craft that should a Weyr or Hold receive a Master in posting, it's considered a sign of great respect from that Crafthall. Although every Crafthall will hold back a group of Mastercrafters to ensure the quality of the training being received. These Masters are also responsible for deciding where a Crafter will be posted once they ‘walk the tables’ into Journeyman/Journeywoman status.

### Walking the tables

With ceremony being considered important for everyone, walking the tables itself has become a ritual that all seem to look forward to. 

Each crafthall has a large dining room, with tables laid out, where depending on what table you were seated at, would be a silent marker as to your rank. Anyone trying to sit at the wrong table would be moved to the correct table.

During the final meal of the day, crafters would gather for food and then the Craftmaster or their Second would make an announcement that a number of Crafters would be walking the tables. For apprentices going up to Journeyman/Journeywoman, the most senior journeyman/journeywoman would stand, walk over to them, place their hands on their shoulder and then guide them to their new table and aid them in getting seated again. 

For journeyman/journeywoman, the Craftermaster [if available] would touch their backs, asking them to stand and they’d be given a drink before they would be guided to the Masters Table.

### Difference between Hallcraft and Holdcraft/Weyrcraft

A distinction is clearly drawn between Crafts and the more homely Holdcraft/Weyrcraft. Several crafts whilst having their own Halls and Halls of learning are basic skills that no Hold or Weyr can do with out, including Farmercraft, Cooking craft and Beastcraft. As such, there are Holdcrafts Weyrcrafts that have these skills, but lack the specialization of the Hall Crafts. 

To make sure that conflicts wouldn’t arise, all Crafthalls are considered autonomous from Hold and Weyr.
